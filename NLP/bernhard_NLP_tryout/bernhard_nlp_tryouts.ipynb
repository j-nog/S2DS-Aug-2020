       "'\\nImmigration Rules part 1: leave to enter or stay in the UK\\nGeneral provisions regarding entry clearance, leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom (paragraphs 7 to 39E).\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave to enter the United Kingdom\\n\\n7.A person who is neither a British citizen nor a Commonwealth citizen with the right of abode nor a person who is entitled to enter or remain in the United Kingdom by virtue of the provisions of the 2006 EEA Regulations requires leave to enter the United Kingdom.\\n8.Under Sections 3 and 4 of the Immigration Act 1971 an Immigration Officer when admitting  to the United Kingdom a person subject to immigration control under that Act may give leave to enter for a limited period and, if he does, may impose all or any of the following conditions:\\n    \\n(i) a condition restricting employment or occupation in the United Kingdom;\\n(ii) a condition requiring the person to maintain and accommodate himself, and any dependants of his, without recourse to public funds;\\n(iii) a condition requiring the person to register with the police; and\\n(iv) a condition restricting his studies in the United Kingdom\\n\\n\\n\\nHe may also require him to report to the appropriate Medical Officer of Environmental Health. Under Section 24 of the 1971 Act it is an offence knowingly to remain beyond the time limit or fail to comply with such a condition or requirement.\\n\\n9.The time limit and any conditions attached will be made known to the person concerned either:\\n    \\n(i) by written notice given to him or endorsed by the Immigration Officer in his passport or travel document; or\\n(ii) in any other manner permitted by the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000.\\n\\n\\n\\nExercise of the power to refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom or to cancel leave to enter or remain which is in force\\n\\n10.The power to refuse leave to enter the United Kingdom or to cancel leave to enter or remain which is already in force is not to be exercised by an Immigration Officer acting on his own. The authority of a Chief Immigration Officer or of an Immigration Inspector must always be obtained.\\n\\nSuspension of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom\\n\\n10A. Where a person has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter or remain which is in force but which was given to him before his arrival he may be examined by an Immigration Officer under paragraph 2A of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971. An Immigration Officer examining a person under paragraph 2A may suspend that person’s leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom until the examination is completed.\\n\\nCancellation of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom\\n\\n10.B Where a person arrives in the United Kingdom with leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom which is already in force, an Immigration Officer may cancel that leave.\\n\\nRequirement for persons arriving in the United Kingdom or seeking entry through the Channel Tunnel to produce evidence of identity and nationality\\n\\n11.A person must, on arrival in the United Kingdom or when seeking entry through the \\nChannel Tunnel, produce on request by the Immigration Officer:\\n    \\n(i) a valid national passport or other document satisfactorily establishing his identity and nationality; and\\n(ii) such information as may be required to establish whether he requires leave to enter the United Kingdom and, if so, whether and on what terms leave to enter should be given.\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirement for a person not requiring leave to enter the United Kingdom to prove that he has the right of abode\\n\\n12. A person claiming to be a British citizen must prove that he has the right of abode in the United Kingdom by producing either:\\n    \\n(i) a United Kingdom passport describing him as a British citizen or as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies having the right of abode in the United Kingdom; or\\n(ii) a certificate of entitlement duly issued by or on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom certifying that he has the right of abode.\\n\\n\\n13. A person claiming to be a Commonwealth citizen with the right of abode in the United \\nKingdom must prove that he has the right of abode by producing a certificate of entitlement \\nduly issued to him by or on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom certifying that \\nhe has the right of abode.\\n14. A Commonwealth citizen who has been given limited leave to enter the United Kingdom may later claim to have the right of abode. The time limit on his stay may be removed if he is \\nable to establish a claim to the right of abode, for example by showing that:\\n    \\n(i) immediately before the commencement of the British Nationality Act 1981 he was a Commonwealth citizen born to or legally adopted by a parent who at the time of the birth had \\ncitizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies by his birth in the United Kingdom or any of the Islands; and\\n(ii) he has not ceased to be a Commonwealth citizen in the meanwhile.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommon Travel Area\\n\\n15.The United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland \\ncollectively form a common travel area. A person who has been examined for the purpose of  immigration control at the point at which he entered the area does not normally require leave to enter any other part of it. However certain persons subject to the Immigration (Control of Entry through the Republic of Ireland) Order 1972 (as amended) who enter the United Kingdom through the Republic of Ireland do require leave to enter. This includes:\\n    \\n(i) those who merely passed through the Republic of Ireland;\\n(ii)persons requiring visas;\\n(iii)persons who entered the Republic of Ireland unlawfully;\\n(iv)persons who are subject to directions given by the Secretary of State for their exclusion from the United Kingdom on the ground that their exclusion is conducive to the public good;\\n(v)persons who entered the Republic from the United Kingdom and Islands after entering \\nthere unlawfully or overstaying their leave.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdmission of certain British passport holders\\n\\n16. A person in any of the following categories may be admitted freely to the United Kingdom on production of a United Kingdom passport issued in the United Kingdom and Islands or the \\nRepublic of Ireland prior to 1 January 1973, unless his passport has been endorsed to show that he was subject to immigration control:\\n    \\n(i) a British Dependent Territories citizen;\\n(ii) a British National (Overseas);\\n(iii) a British Overseas citizen;\\n(iv) a British protected person;\\n(v) a British subject by virtue of Section 30(a) of the British Nationality Act 1981, (who, immediately before the commencement of the 1981 Act would have been a British subject not \\npossessing citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies or the citizenship of any other Commonwealth country or territory).\\n\\n\\n17. British Overseas citizens who hold United Kingdom passports wherever issued and who \\nsatisfy the Immigration Officer that they have, since 1 March 1968, been given indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom may be given indefinite leave to enter.\\n\\nPersons outside the United Kingdom\\n\\n17A. Where a person is outside the United Kingdom but wishes to travel to the United Kingdom an Immigration Officer may give or refuse him leave to enter. An Immigration Officer may exercise these powers whether or not he is, himself, in the United Kingdom. However, an Immigration Officer is not obliged to consider an application for leave to enter from a person outside the United Kingdom.\\n17B. Where a person having left the common travel area, has leave to enter the United \\nKingdom which remains in force under article 13 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and \\nRemain) Order 2000, an Immigration Officer may cancel that leave. An Immigration Officer may exercise these powers whether or not he is, himself, in the United Kingdom. If a person \\noutside the United Kingdom has leave to remain in the United Kingdom which is in force in \\nthis way, the Secretary of State may cancel that leave.\\n\\nReturning Residents\\n\\n18. A person may resume their residence in the UK provided the Immigration Officer is satisfied that the person concerned:\\n    \\n(i) had indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom when he last left; and\\n(ii) has not been away from the United Kingdom for more than 2 years; and\\n(iii) did not receive assistance from public funds towards the cost of leaving the United Kingdom; and\\n(iv) now seeks admission for the purpose of settlement.\\n\\n\\n18A. Those who qualify to resume their residence in accordance with paragraph 18 do not need a visa to enter the UK.\\n19. A person who does not benefit from the preceding paragraph by reason only of having been absent from the United Kingdom for more than two consecutive years, must have applied for, and been granted indefinite leave to enter by way of entry clearance if, he can demonstrate he has strong ties to the United Kingdom and intends to make the United Kingdom his permanent home.\\n19A. Sub paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 18 shall not apply where a person who has indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom accompanies on an overseas posting a partner, parent, a spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner or same-sex partner who is:\\na) a member of HM Forces serving overseas; or\\nb) a British citizen or is settled in the UK and\\n    \\n(i) a permanent member of HM Diplomatic Service;\\n(ii) a comparable United Kingdom based permanent staff member of the British Council;\\n(iii) a permanent staff member of the Department for International Development; or\\n(iv) a permanent Home Office employee.\\n\\n\\n20.The leave of a person whose stay in the United Kingdom is subject to a time limit lapses on his going to a country or territory outside the common travel area if the leave was given for a period of six months or less or conferred by a visit visa. In other cases, leave lapses on the holder remaining outside the United Kingdom for a continuous period of more than two years. A person whose leave has lapsed and who returns after a temporary absence abroad within the period of this earlier leave has no claim to admission as a returning resident. His application to re-enter the United Kingdom should be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances. The same time limit and any conditions attached will normally be reimposed if he meets the requirements of these Rules, unless he is seeking admission in a different capacity from the one in which he was last given leave to enter or remain.\\n\\nNon-lapsing leave\\n\\n20A. Leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom will usually lapse on the holder going to a country or territory outside the common travel area. However, under article 13 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 such leave will not lapse where it was \\ngiven for a period exceeding six months or where it was conferred by means of an entry \\nclearance (other than a visit visa).\\n20B. Those who seek leave to enter the United Kingdom within the period of their earlier leave and for the same purpose as that for which that leave was granted, unless it\\n    \\n(i) was for a period of six months or less; or\\n(ii) was extended by statutory instrument or by section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 (inserted by section 3 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999);\\ndo not need a visa to enter the UK.\\n\\n\\n\\nHolders of restricted travel documents and passports\\n\\n21. The leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom of the holder of a passport or travel \\ndocument whose permission to enter another country has to be exercised before a given date may be restricted so as to terminate at least 2 months before that date.\\n22. If his passport or travel document is endorsed with a restriction on the period for \\nwhich he may remain outside his country of normal residence, his leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom may be limited so as not to extend beyond the period of authorised absence.\\n23.The holder of a travel document issued by the Home Office should not be given leave to \\nenter or remain for a period extending beyond the validity of that document. This paragraph and paragraphs 21-22 do not apply to a person who is eligible for admission for settlement or to a spouse or civil partner who is eligible for admission under paragraph 282 or to a person who qualifies for the removal of the time limit on his stay.\\n\\nLeave to enter granted on arrival in the United Kingdom\\n\\n\\n23A. A person who is not a visa national and who is seeking leave to enter on arrival in the United Kingdom for a period not exceeding 6 months for a purpose for which prior entry clearance is not required under these Rules may be granted such leave, for a period not exceeding 6 months. This paragraph does not apply where the person is a British National (Overseas), a British overseas territories citizen, a British Overseas citizen, a British protected person, or a person who under the British Nationality Act 1981 is a British subject.\\n\\n\\n23B. A person who is a British National (Overseas), a British overseas territories citizen, a British Overseas citizen, a British protected person, or a person who under the British Nationality Act 1981 is a British subject, and who is seeking leave to enter on arrival in the United Kingdom for a purpose for which prior entry clearance is not required under these Rules may be granted such leave, irrespective of the period of time for which he seeks entry, for a period not exceeding 6 months.\\n\\n\\nEntry clearance\\n\\n24. The following:\\n    \\n(i)\\ta visa national;\\n(ii) a non visa national not a British national and is seeking entry for a period exceeding six months, or for a purpose for which prior entry clearance is required under these Rules;\\n(iii) a British national without the right of abode who is seeking entry for a purpose for which prior entry clearance is required under these Rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmust either:\\n    \\n(i) produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport or other identity document endorsed with a United Kingdom entry clearance, issued to him for the purpose for which he seeks entry, which is still in force,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nor:\\n    \\n(ii) where he has been granted a United Kingdom entry clearance which was issued to him in electronic form for the purpose for which he seeks entry and which is still in force, produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport or other identity document.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch a person will be refused leave to enter if he has no such current entry clearance.  Any other person who wishes to ascertain in advance whether he is eligible for admission to the United Kingdom may apply for the issue of an entry clearance.\\n\\n25. Entry clearance takes the form of a visa (for visa nationals) or an entry certificate (for non visa nationals). A visa or an entry certificate may be issued in electronic form. These documents are to be taken as evidence of the holder’s eligibility for entry into the United Kingdom, and accordingly accepted as “entry clearances” within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971.\\n25A. An entry clearance which satisfies the requirements set out in article 3 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 will have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom. The requirements are that the entry clearance must specify the purpose for which the holder wishes to enter the United Kingdom and should be endorsed with the conditions to which it is subject or wish a statement that it has effect as indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom. The holder of such an entry clearance will not require leave to enter on arrival in the United Kingdom and, for the purposes of these Rules, will be treated as a person who has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter the United Kingdom which is in force but which was given to him before his arrival.\\n26. An application for entry clearance will be considered in accordance with the provisions in these Rules governing the grant or refusal of leave to enter. Where appropriate, the term “Entry Clearance Officer” should be substituted for “Immigration Officer”.\\n\\n27. An application for entry clearance is to be decided in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of the decision, except that an applicant will not be refused an entry clearance where entry is sought in one of the categories contained in paragraphs 296-316 or paragraph EC-C of Appendix FM solely on account of his attaining the age of 18 years between receipt of his application and the date of the decision on it.\\n\\n\\n28.

A sponsor of a person seeking leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom may be asked to give an undertaking in writing to be responsible for that person’s maintenance, accommodation and (as appropriate) personal care for the period of any leave granted, including any further variation or for a period of 5 years from date of grant where indefinite leave to enter or remain is granted. Under the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992, the Department of Social Security or, as the case may be, the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland, may seek to recover from the person giving such an undertaking any income support paid to meet the needs of the person in respect of whom the undertaking has been given. Under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 the Home Office may seek to recover from the person giving such an undertaking amounts attributable to any support provided under section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (support for asylum seekers) to, or in respect of, the person in respect of whom the undertaking has been given. Failure by the sponsor to maintain that person in accordance with the undertaking, may also be an offence under section 105 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and/or under section 108 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 if, as a consequence, asylum support and/or income support is provided to, or in respect of, that person.\\n\\nMedical\\n\\n36. A person who intends to remain in the United Kingdom for more than 6 months should normally be referred to the Medical Inspector for examination. If he produces a medical certificate he should be advised to hand it to the Medical Inspector. Any person seeking entry who mentions health or medical treatment as a reason for his visit, or who appears not to be in good mental or physical health, should also be referred to the Medical Inspector; and the Immigration Officer has discretion, which should be exercised sparingly, to refer for examination in any other case.\\n37. Where the Medical Inspector advises that a person seeking entry is suffering from a specified disease or condition which may interfere with his ability to support himself or his dependants, the Immigration Officer should take account of this, in conjunction with other factors, in deciding whether to admit that person. The Immigration Officer should also take account of the Medical Inspector’s assessment of the likely course of treatment in deciding whether a person seeking entry for private medical treatment has sufficient means at his disposal.\\n38. A returning resident should not be refused leave to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain cancelled on medical grounds. But where a person would be refused leave to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain cancelled on medical grounds if he were not a returning resident or in any case where it is decided on compassionate grounds not to exercise the power to refuse leave to enter or to cancel existing leave to enter or remain, or in any other case where the Medical Inspector so recommends, the Immigration Officer should give the person concerned a notice requiring him to report to the Medical Officer of Environmental Health designated by the Medical Inspector with a view to further examination and any necessary treatment.\\nA39. Any person making an application for entry clearance to come to the UK for more than six months or as a fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner applying for leave to enter under Section EC-P:Entry clearance as a partner under Appendix FM, having been present in a country listed in Appendix T for more than six months immediately prior to their application, must present, at the time of application, a valid medical certificate issued by a medical practitioner approved by the Secretary of State for these purposes, as listed on the Gov.uk website, confirming that they have undergone screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis and that this tuberculosis is not present in the applicant.\\nB39. Applicants seeking leave to enter as a returning resident under paragraph 19 of these \\nrules, having been absent from the United Kingdom for more than two years are also subject to the requirements in paragraph A39.\\nC39. Where a person has lawfully been present in a country not mentioned in Appendix T for more than six months and they are applying for entry clearance as in A39 in a country in Appendix T but have not been in that country or any other country mentioned in Appendix T for more than six months immediately before making their application, they will not be required to produce a medical certificate showing they are free from active pulmonary TB. This does not alter the discretionary powers as in paragraph 39 below.\\n39. The Entry Clearance Officer has the same discretion as an Immigration Officer to refer applicants for entry clearance for medical examination and the same principles will apply to the decision whether or not to issue an entry clearance.\\n\\nStudents\\n39A. An application for a variation of leave to enter or remain made by a student who is sponsored by a government or international sponsorship agency may be refused if the sponsor has not given written consent to the proposed variation.\\nSpecified documents\\n\\n39B.
