restructuring exercise you do not need to do anything about that dormant licence expiring you will continue to be able to access it until the last grant of leave for a migrant sponsored under that

page 110 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 the appropriate rate specified in appendix j to the immigration rules salary information on a certificate of sponsorship all tier 2 categories 2619 when you assign a cos to a migrant you must give 3 pieces of information about the salary package the gross salary figure which must represent the total amount paid to the worker gross of any tax paid whether paid in the uk or overseas and must include any permitted allowances and guaranteed bonuses a separate figure for the total of all allowances and guaranteed bonuses a detailed breakdown of each allowance and each guaranteed bonus showing their value where the migrant is paid hourly the appropriate salary consideration will be based on earnings up to a maximum of 48 hours a week even if the migrant works for longer than this for example a migrant who works 60 hours a week for 10 per hour would be considered to have a salary of 24960 (10x48x52) and not 31200 (10x60x52) this migrant would therefore not be awarded points for appropriate salary 2620 where the migrant will be working in the uk for fewer than 12 months the rate of pay must be based on an annual salary for example earnings of 15000 on a 6month contract would add up to an annual salary of 30000 2621 the figure given for the gross salary must not be inflated in expectation of any tax relief such as relief on expenditure related to the employment or tax incurred by the employment of a resident worker but not incurred for a migrant an example of this is if the gross salary package is 21000 but the migrant worker will have the same net package after tax as a resident worker who is paid 25000 before tax the cos must show that the salary package is 21000 not 25000 2622 salary may be paid in the uk or abroad where the migrant will be paid from abroad in currency other than pounds sterling the salary entered on the cos must be based on the exchange rate for the relevant currency on the day the cos is assigned taken from the rates published on oanda 2623 the salary package on the cos may also include any guaranteed allowances such as london weighting or accommodation which will be paid for the duration of the applicants employment in the uk these allowances may only be included if they would also be paid to a settled worker there is one exception to this you may also pay tier 2 (ict) migrants allowances to cover the additional cost of living in the uk and mobility premiums paid as a percentage of base pay 2624 the salary package on the cos must not include page 111 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 nan 2626 migrants sponsored under tier 2 or tier 5 (temporary worker) can take short periods of unpaid leave but you must stop sponsoring a migrant who is absent from work without pay for 4 weeks or more in total in any calendar year the only exceptions to this are where the unpaid absence is for one or more of the following reasons statutory maternity leave statutory paternity leave statutory parental leave statutory shared parental leave statutory adoption leave sick leave assisting with a national or international humanitarian or environmental crisis overseas provided you agreed to the absence for that purpose taking part in strike action as part of a legally organised industrial action 2627 where you are required to stop sponsoring a migrant who has been absent from work without pay for 4 weeks or more you must report this using your sponsorship management system (sms) account this applies whether the migrant is absent from work over a single period or more than one period during any calendar year (1 january to 31 december) the 4 weeks is worked out according to the migrants normal working pattern an example of this is if the migrant works 3 days per week (3 days x 4 weeks) it would be 12 working days page 112 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 2628 if a sponsored migrant wishes to take a longer period of other unpaid leave such as a sabbatical you must stop sponsoring them and report this using your sms account 2629 if you decide to cut a migrants salary package to a lower rate than you stated on their cos such as if the allowances offered have changed the new rate that you pay to them must meet the current appropriate rate requirements 2630 if the new rate is below the appropriate rate you cannot continue to sponsor them and you must report this to us using your sms account 2631 the only exceptions to this rule are where the reduction in salary is due to a period of leave for any reason given in paragraph 2626 above the reduction is due to the migrant undertaking professional examinations to assess whether their skills meet uk standards before starting work for you where the passing of such examinations is a regulatory requirement for the job the migrant will be sponsored to do this could include o nurses undertaking the objectivestructured clinical examination o doctors undertaking the professional and linguistic assessment (osce) board (plab) test in the case of a tier 2 (intracompany transfer) migrant the reduction is due to them not being physically present in the uk 2632 if the migrant was granted leave under tier 2 (general) as a high earner and the reduction in salary takes them below the high earner threshold the migrant must make a new application for leave related content contents page 113 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 27 tier 2 (general) 27 as a tier 2 (general) sponsor you will normally be the employer and responsible for paying the migrant there are certain circumstances such as in parts of the creative sector where there is no direct employeremployee relationship in such circumstances the migrant must still have a sponsor that is able and willing to accept all of the responsibilities and duties associated with being their sponsor 271 there will also be circumstances where there is a clear statutory relationship between the employing body and a publicly funded body where the publicly funded body can intervene in the running or funding of the employing or paying body in these cases the publicly funded body can be the sponsor below are 2 examples of this example 1 a local authority has powers of control and direction over selfgoverning schools so the local authority can sponsor teachers in these schools example 2 a strategic health authority through its deanery local education and training board (letb) or providercommissioning organisation has funding control of training posts for doctors and dentists within nhs trusts even though it is not the paying body in this case the deanery or letb can be the sponsor 272 where a migrant is not your direct employee we will look closely at the arrangement to make sure that you can fulfil your sponsor duties we monitor you to make sure that you are fulfilling your duties and take action if we find that you are not the tier 2 (general) annual limit 273 there is an annual limit of 20700 certificates of sponsorship (cos) available to sponsors under tier 2 (general) the limit runs from 6 april each year to 5 april the following year

where the job is in a supernumerary research position over and above your normal staffing requirements this is where the migrant has been granted a scientific research award or fellowship by either page 118 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 a thirdparty organisation and the award or fellowship cannot be transferred to anyone else or you (the sponsor) if o the migrant has been selected through a competitive process on the basis of their own research proposal and o the funding of the research is secured in an agreement between the sponsor and a thirdparty organisation which includes objectively justified requirements that effectively prohibit any settled worker from undertaking the role this exemption continues to apply after the relevant thirdparty funding has ended as long as the migrant is being sponsored to continue to undertake the same research 2812 you do not need to carry out a resident labour market test if the migrant will be sponsored as a doctor in speciality training where their salary and the costs of their training are being met by the government of another country under an agreement with the uk government has already started speciality training as a doctor or dentist in the uk and they are applying to continue that training or return to that training (with the same national training number) after an outofprogramme experience you must confirm on the certificate of sponsorship (cos) that this exception to the resident labour market test applies 2813 if a speciality training doctor or dentist wishes to undertake an outofprogramme experience in the uk then the organisation providing this will need to become the new sponsor you as the current sponsor must tell us that you no longer have sponsorship responsibilities for the migrant because they are taking an outofprogramme experience if you are the sponsor that is offering the out of programme experience you must have carried out the resident labour market test before you assign a cos 2814 when the outofprogramme experience in the uk has finished the migrant may need to return to their speciality training you must assign a new cos but will not need to carry out a resident labour market test if the migrant is returning to the same training programme you must confirm on the cos that an exception to the resident labour market test applies if you were the sponsor for the migrant when they did their outofprogramme experience you must tell us that you are no longer sponsoring the migrant 2815 when a postgraduate doctor or dentist is accepted for speciality training they are given a national training number (ntn) you must produce this when asked for as evidence that the doctor or dentist was undertaking training before the outofprogramme experience page 119 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 2816 you do not need to carry out a resident labour market test where the job offer is for the migrant to work in support of a posting from an overseas firm to you in connection with the relocation of a high value business to the uk or a significant new inward investment project where you were registered in the uk with companies house no earlier than 3 years before the date the cos was assigned you are the registered branch or wholly owned subsidiary of a business which has its headquarters and principal place of business outside the uk the relocation or inward investment involves new capital expenditure of 27 million or the creation of at least 21 new uk jobs and you are able to provide evidence of this if required you or the overseas business of which you are the branch or subsidiary must be the entity directly making the investment for this purpose working in support of an inward investment project does not include the supply of services to a thirdparty client who is making an investment the capital expenditure or job creation does not need to have taken place before you assign the cos but you must be able to provide evidence that this will take place as part of the existing project how to carry out the resident labour market test tier 2 (general) 2817 unless an exemption as outlined in this section applies all jobs must be advertised to settled workers for 28 calendar days you can advertise jobs in 2 ways advertise the vacancy for a single continuous period with a minimum closing date of 28 calendar days from the date the advertisement first appeared advertise the vacancy in 2 stages with each stage being advertised for no fewer than 7 calendar days but where both stages total a minimum of 28 calendar days below is an example of this example you could at first advertise the vacancy for 14 calendar days and appoint any suitable settled worker who applies if no suitable settled worker applies you cannot appoint a migrant worker at this stage as you must advertise the vacancy for a further 14 calendar days making 28 calendar days in total if no suitable settled worker applies during either the first or second stage then the resident labour market test has been passed and you can appoint a tier 2 migrant the vacancy must have been advertised for at least 28 days within the 6 months before you assign the cos to a migrant 2818 you must place 2 advertisements using the methods set out in this guidance the job advertisement must be in english unless based in wales where it page 120 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 nan 2822 the salary rate in your advertisement must be a true reflection of what you are prepared to pay and the rate you ultimately pay must be in line with the rate that was advertised unless the transitional provision outlined below applies you cannot advertise at a low rate (for example the new starter rate) and then offer a higher rate to a migrant to allow them to make a successful application below is an example of this example if you advertised a salary rate of 32000 to 35000 you can only sponsor a migrant if the salary you state on their cos is within that range if you want to pay a higher salary you must carry out the resident labour market test again page 121 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 advertising at the higher rate as there may be settled workers who would apply for the job at the higher rate 2823 when deciding the salary range to put in a job advertisement you should consider if you are willing to offer a higher salary to a more experienced worker this is important because the purpose of the resident labour market test is to make sure job opportunities are made available to the settled workforce transitional provision for jobs advertised before 30 march 2019 2824 the appropriate rates of pay in appendix j to the immigration rules were updated on 30 march 2019 (see the rates of pay section of this guidance) if you advertised a job before 30 march 2019 but you assign a cos on or after that date you may find that the highest salary stated in your advertisement is lower than the new appropriate rate set out in the rates of pay section if this happens the salary you state on the cos must meet the new appropriate rate if this is higher than the rate you originally advertised you do not need to carry out a new resident labour market test example you advertised a job before 30 march 2019 with a salary range of 32000 to 35000 at the time the job was advertised the appropriate experienced worker rate for the job as specified in appendix j to the immigration rules was 34500 however for cos assigned on or after 30 march 2019 the new appropriate rate is 36000 in this scenario as long as you pay the migrant at least 36000 you do not need to carry out a further resident labour market test 2825 for each recruitment method where you have carried out the resident labour market test you must keep the documents listed in appendix d of the guidance for sponsors if you fail to advertise a job vacancy in line with the requirements set out in this guidance we will take action against you resident labour market test tier 2 (general) advertising methods 2826 the following paragraphs describe the different methods of advertising we accept when carrying out a resident labour market test unless an exemption applies all jobs must be advertised using 2 of the methods set out in this section in many cases this will be mandatory

service is not mandatory you can choose any of the permitted media to advertise in for example you could choose one national newspaper and one professional journal we will also accept 2 advertisements using the same form of media for example advertisements on 2 different websites provided the websites meet our criteria for websites page 122 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 nan 2827 unless an exception listed in paragraph 2820 applies one of your advertisments must be via a relevant online government jobsearch service which service you use depends on where the job is based and the type of job the relevant services are find a job (which replaced the universal jobmatch service from 14 may 2018) for jobs based in england scotland or wales jobcentre online for jobs based in northern ireland the govuk teaching vacancies service for teaching jobs based in england 2828 these services will only accept online vacancy advertisements when there is a current vacancy at the time the advertisement is placed if you use rolling recruitment programmes you will need to make sure that your vacancies are placed when there are actual posts to fill you must adhere to the rules set out by these services if your online vacancy advertisement is refused you will not be able to meet the resident labour market test criteria and will not be able to assign a cos find a job 2829 if the job is based in england (other than certain teaching vacancies see below) wales or scotland it must be advertised via the find a job service on govuk jobs are advertised online directly by employers using advertise a job 2830 the standard period for an advertisement to run on find a job is 30 days but you can set an earlier closing date the closing date for applications will not be visible unless it is included in the job description so if you advertise a job with a closing date that is earlier than 30 days from the date it was first advertised you must make sure that it is stated in the job description in all cases you must ensure that the job is advertised for a minimum total period of 28 days jobcentre online 2831 if the job is based in northern ireland it must be

advertise via find a job instead of or as well as teaching vacancies however if you use both services this will count as one advertisement for the purposes of satisfying the resident labour market test and you will still need to advertise via one other acceptable medium listed below 2835 a national newspaper is one published at least once a week and marketed throughout the uk or throughout the devolved nation in which the job is located this could be the scotsman and the herald which are suitable national newspapers for jobs in scotland the western mail for jobs in wales and the belfast telegraph for jobs in northern ireland 2836 a professional journal is one published for a particular field and is available nationally either through retail outlets or subscription the journal must be

you use a milkround to recruit new graduates or interns you must visit a minimum of 3 uk universities or all uk universities which provide the relevant course whichever is the lower number 2838 the milkround or graduate recruitment programme does not need to be advertised through find a job or jobcentre online in northern ireland to meet the resident labour market test but must be advertised through 2 methods permitted by this guidance one of which must be a prominent graduate recruitment website which does not charge a fee to jobseekers to view job advertisements or to apply for jobs via those advertisements you must keep evidence to prove that no suitable settled workers were available to fill the vacancy 2839 rolling recruitment programmes allow companies to pick out skilled individuals who might fill future undefined vacancies rather than specific ones 2840 we understand why you may want to identify migrants through these programmes and we dont want to stop this happening however to meet the page 124 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 requirements of the resident labour market test when a specific vacancy becomes available it must be advertised as set out in this guidance to give settled workers a chance to apply 2841 you can use an agency or headhunter to help with your recruitment they may recruit for the post on your behalf but the recruitment exercise must meet the requirements of the resident labour market test 2842 where an agency or headhunter carries out the recruitment exercise you are fully responsible for the resident labour market test if it is not done in line with the rules we will take action against you 2843 you can advertise the job online we do not restrict you to specific websites but it must be one of the following the relevant online government jobsearch service (find a job jobcentre online or teaching vacancies) this is mandatory unless an exception in paragraph 2819 above applies an

certificates because there is no limit on how many you can get providing you can justify your request you must provide evidence to support your request we may ask you for further information before we take a decision we will also take a number of reasons into account including any agents that you will use to recruit workers and whether they have been linked to immigration abuse in the past the purpose of your organisations business the number of workers now employed at your organisation the length of time that you have been operating your history of compliance with the immigration rules and sponsor guidance (if you have one) if we grant fewer cos than you asked for this may be because you have a history of noncompliance you cannot justify your need for the number you asked for we do not consider your need to be credible based on your current you are unsure whether or when you may need to recruit any migrants in circumstances the future we will add your cos allocation to your sms account and give you 12 months from the beginning of your licence to assign the cos after that time any unassigned cos will expire 2910 if you are a tier 2 (general) sponsor and your cos year is coming to an end you can apply for a followon allocation for the next year sms guide 2 manage your sponsorship licence has more information on this 2911 before assigning a tier 2 (general)

unallocated returned or reclaimed during the last month in line with the procedures set out in paragraphs 83 to 84a of appendix a to the immigration rules 2914 if you need to assign a restricted cos to a migrant you must apply for it using the restricted cos application process we cannot guarantee your application will be successful if your licence is brated for tier 2 (general) or suspended you are not allowed to apply for any restricted cos 2915 the application process works to a monthly cycle you can make an application at any time using your sponsorship management system (sms) account each application we receive will be scored against a set of criteria on the 11th day of each month we will decide how many applications made on or before the 5th day of the same month can be approved we call this the allocation date applications will be decided on the next working day if the 11th day of the month falls on either a saturday page 130 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 sunday bank holiday in england if your application is successful your restricted certificates of sponsorship will appear in your sms account on the relevant allocation date 2916 you apply for a restricted certificate of sponsorship (cos) using your sponsorship management system (sms) account the application can only be made by a level 1 user there is no fee to apply for a restricted cos 2917 you should only apply for a restricted cos if you intend to assign it no more than 3 months after the allocation date appropriate to your application if your application is successful the restricted cos will be allocated to your sms account but if not assigned after 3 months it will be removed from your account if a restricted cos is removed and you still need it you will have to apply again 2918 when you apply for a restricted cos you must have carried out a resident labour market test (where applicable) that meets the requirements in this guidance 2919 when you make your application you must fill in all mandatory fields marked with an asterisk if you do not you will not be able to send your application all information you give on salary payments skill level and the resident labour market test must be in line with how a tier 2 (general) unrestricted cos is assigned the tier specific duties under tier 2 (general) and tier 2 (intracompany transfer (ict)) section has more information on this 2920 we may wish to check the information you send with your application for example if we have doubts about its validity if we need to make any checks we may ask for more information or documents you must send us any information or documents within 10 working days if you do not your application will be rejected 2921 if you do send the information or documents within the time limit but the date we receive them is on or after the allocation date you have applied for or we are unable to make the necessary checks before the allocation date you have applied for we will hold your application until the following allocation date if we have been unable to carry out those checks by the following allocation date your application will be rejected 2922 applications for a restricted certificate of sponsorship (cos) will be scored and prioritised based on the job and recruitment criteria set out in the table below and the gross annual salary you pay to the migrant (see points for salary below) page 131 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 2923 no application for a restricted cos will be granted unless it scores points for both job and recruitment and for gross annual salary 2924 we cannot guarantee any valid application will result in the allocation of a restricted cos for example if your application scores 30 points for job and recruitment but we complete checks which reveal that you have not carried out a resident labour market test in accordance with this guidance we will not award those points and your application will be rejected 2925 we cannot guarantee that a salary which is approved in a restricted cos application will be accepted when a migrant makes a tier 2 application for example if you apply for a restricted cos with a salary of 20800 but you later assign it to a migrant who is not exempt from the 30000 salary threshold their application will be refused 2926 the table below sets out the points that will be awarded based on the type of job the migrant will do and the recruitment campaign used (where relevant) job and recruitment shortage occupation resident labour market test met via the milkround and the individual being sponsored meets the poststudy work requirements (other than they will be applying for entry clearance rather than leave to remain) the job is in one of the following public service occupations 2217 medical radiographers 2314 secondary education teaching professionals subject teachers in maths physics chemistry computer science and mandarin only 3213 paramedics and the job passes the resident labour market test or an exemption applies job passes the resident labour market test or an exemption applies points 320 30 30 20 2927 your application can only score points for one entry in the table above for example if a job is a shortage occupation but you have carried out a resident labour market test your application will score 320 points not 340 2928 we will award one point for each 1000 of gross annual salary up to a page 132 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 maximum of 160000 we calculate the salary in accordance with the rules in paragraphs 79 to 79c of appendix a to the immigration rules see salary information on a certificate of sponsorship for further guidance 2929 in your application you must state the salary that you will pay to the migrant if you are allocated a restricted cos if you do not yet have a confirmed salary you must state the minimum salary that you are willing to pay if you are subsequently allocated a cos you can increase the salary when you come to assign it to a migrant (subject to the limitations stated in paragraph 2946) but you cannot pay less than you stated you would in your application for a restricted cos 2930 we will not award points for salary if it is not at or above the appropriate rate for the job 2931 below is an example of how we might score an application the job is in a specified public service occupation and passes the resident labour market test and the salary (including permitted allowances) is 36600 your application will score 30 points for job and recruitment plus a further 36 points for salary (provided the salary meets the appropriate rate specified in appendix j to the rules) giving 66 points in total 2932 each application received for a restricted certificate of sponsorship (cos) will be scored in line with the points table above all applications received up to and including the 5th of each month that are not subject to checks will be considered on the 11th of that month the allocation date an example of this is if you apply between 6 november and 5 december your application will be decided on the 11 december 2933 we will approve valid applications solely on the number of points scored starting with the highest if the number of valid applications received is more than the number of cos available those applications scoring the lowest points are less likely to be approved 2934 we may reach a point where there are more applications that score the same amount of points than we have cos available below is an example of this example we have allocated all applications scoring between 480 points and 48 points and we are left with more applications that have scored 47 points than we have cos left to allocate if this happens we cannot make a fair decision as to whether any of these are more urgent or worthy than others therefore we will either approve all of them or none of them 2935 we will approve all applications that score the same number of points if this page 133 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 means that we exceed our monthly allocation limit by 100 or fewer below are 2 examples which show what happens when the monthly allocation is exceeded example 1 on 11 september all valid applications scoring between 480 points and 48 points have been approved we have 150 cos left to allocate and 250 applicants scoring 47 points we will award cos to all 250 applicants as it will only lead to our monthly allocation being exceeded by 100 example 2 on 11 september all valid applications scoring between 480 points and 48 points have been approved we have 150 cos left to allocate there are 400 valid applications that all score 47 points we will not allocate any cos for any valid application scoring 47 points because we would exceed our monthly limit by more than 100 we will carry over the 150 unallocated cos to the following month 2936 the decision we make is based on the number of points your application has scored nothing else will be taken into account and there is no right of appeal if your application is successful your restricted cos will appear in your sms account on the relevant allocation date if unsuccessful you can apply again at any time 2937 if the monthly allocation process is undersubscribed we will carry over any cos that remain unallocated to the following month any cos that remain unallocated at the end of each year covered by the limit will not be carried forward to the next years allocation 2938 there may be compelling circumstances where a cos can be granted exceptionally before the next allocation date applications will be considered on merit and in line with relevant policy it is not possible to give a full list of circumstances that might be defined as compelling however approvals should be rare examples might be where delays caused by us resulted in a newly licensed sponsor needing a cos for a migrant who is due to start work before the 11th of the next month a consultant surgeon has been recruited and needs to be appointed at once because patients need lifesaving surgery before the 11th of the following month 2939 we will not consider any application made due to delays caused by you that could have been avoided for example where a recruitmentappointment was delayed because your staff were absent 2940 if you need to apply in this circumstance you must send your application using your sms account and email the tier 2 limits team asking for your application to be considered urgently and explaining the reasons for this we page 134 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 may ask for documentary evidence to support your application and may visit you 2941 we only consider applications where had they been made earlier it would have been granted on the last allocation date but there is no guarantee that any application will be granted each case will be considered on its merits and we expect robust evidence as to why the application couldnt have been made earlier 2942 we cannot guarantee a timescale for considering urgent applications this is because it may take longer if we need to visit you or ask for documentary evidence to support your application if we cannot verify an application before the next allocation date it will be considered for the one after but only if we can verify it in time see how to apply for a restricted cos for more information 2943 any application for urgent consideration that we refuse will be carried forward to the next allocation date for a decision where we do grant any applications for urgent consideration we will reduce the next monthly allocation accordingly 2944 if we find after granting you a restricted certificate of sponsorship (cos) that your application for that cos was invalid for any reason we will reclaim it from your sponsorship management system (sms) account 2945 if you decide that you no longer need a restricted cos you must do one of the following if the cos is part of an application for a number of identical cos you must first assign the ones you do need then email the tier 2 limits team to let us know that it can be returned if the cos did not form part of an application for a number of identical cos you can email the tier 2 limits team to let us know that it can be returned 2946 you must let us know about any restricted cos which can be returned we can then make them available to other sponsors 2947 the status of any cos that is returned or reclaimed will be updated in your sms account it will display as returned or reclaimed 2948 if your application for a restricted certificate of sponsorship (cos) is successful you will have 3 months to assign it to a migrant if you do not assign it after 3 months it will be removed from your account 2949 if you have any restricted cos in your sms account which are less than 3 months old and which you have not yet assigned and you are downgraded to page 135 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 a b rating for tier 2 (general) or your licence is suspended you will not be able to assign them and they will still be removed from your account after 3 months 2950 you can only assign a restricted cos to fill the restricted job that you described on your application when you apply for a restricted cos the information you give in your application such as the salary and job description will appear on the cos that is allocated to you if your application is successful when you assign that cos you will not be able to change any of these prepopulated fields 2951 we accept that there may occasionally be circumstances in which some of the details you enter on a successful restricted cos application may have changed by the time the cos is allocated to you or you come to assign it although you cannot amend the prepopulated fields when assigning the cos you can add a sponsor note to let us know of the following changes salary increase (where the salary package that you will pay to the migrant is higher than the amount you stated on the application) unless a transitional provision following updates to the appropriate rate applies this is only permitted if the higher rate is still within the salary range quoted in the job advertisement see advertising and salary rate for further information start and end date you can amend either or both of these dates but you should remember that a restricted cos must be assigned within 3 months of it being allocated to your sms account once the cos has been assigned the migrant then has only 3 months to use it to support an application for leave 2952 if you do amend the salary rate using a sponsor note you must also state when adding that sponsor note the salary range that was advertised 2953 these are the only changes you can make to a restricted cos when you assign it if anything else has changed such as a reduction in salary or a change to the standard occupation classification (soc) code or job description you must return the restricted cos to us you must carry out a new resident labour market test where required and apply again at a later date if necessary 2954 you must only assign a restricted cos to a migrant who needs one you should not assign a restricted cos to a migrant who is eligible to be assigned an unrestricted cos 2955 you must only assign a restricted cos if you intend to employ the migrant on the conditions stated on the application you made for it or in any sponsor note added in the circumstances permitted above if we subsequently find that you gave false information on your application for a restricted cos we will revoke your sponsor licence examples include but are not limited to page 136 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 the salary you pay to a migrant whose application for leave was supported by a restricted cos is lower than the salary stated on your application for that cos you

the intracompany transfer arrangements this also includes partners where you are for example a limited liability partnership 302 this route cannot be used to transfer a migrant who is employed by an organisation which is not linked by common ownership or control but who has been contracted by their own employer to work for one of the overseas linked entities below is an example of this example company a overseas and company b in the uk is linked by common ownership or control the migrant is employed by company c overseas which is not linked by common ownership or control to company a or company b but they have been contracted by company c to work at company a this migrant cannot move to company b under the tier 2 (ict) category 303 because of the nature of transfers you do not need to carry out a resident labour market test but there are requirements unique to each subcategory which must be met and migrants must be paid at least the appropriate salary rate permitted for the subcategory under which they will apply for leave 304 under the ict subcategories the job the migrant will do must meet the rules on the skill level and appropriate salary rates as set out in this

migrant has been working continuously and lawfully for your organisation either overseas or in the uk since the start of that aggregated 12month period for example o the migrant worked for you overseas for 6 months then worked for you for 2 years in the uk as the dependant of another migrant before working for you overseas for a further 6 months you can add the two 6month overseas periods together to make the required 12 months an aggregated period of at least 12 months within a 24month period immediately prior to the date of their application for leave if within the 12 months

the coolingoff period 309 this subcategory of tier 2 (ict) can be used to transfer recent graduate recruits to the uk for training for any period up to a maximum of 12 months this route must not be used to fill long term posts a migrant in the tier 2 (ict) structured graduate training programme with progression towards a managerial or specialist role within the organisation page 139 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 3010 you must not use this route to transfer all of your graduate recruits it is only for those on accelerated promotion schemes 3011 the migrant must have been employed outside of the uk by you for a minimum of 3 months before coming to the uk time spent in the uk under the previous tier 2 (ict) skills transfer subcategory (now removed) does not count towards the 3month qualifying period for the tier 2 (ict) graduate trainee subcategory 3012 this subcategory is specifically targeted at the best graduate recruits and you are limited to transferring no more than 20 migrants per financial year under this subcategory if you transfer more than 20 graduate trainees we will take action against you 3013 where a migrant leaves the uk after a period of leave in the tier 2 (ict) future they may be affected by the coolingoff period if they return under any tier 2 category other than the tier 2 (ict) longterm staff subcategory 3014 migrants applying in the tier 2 (intracompany transfer) category may have to give us evidence to prove that they have been working for you or the linked overseas business for the required period the evidence may include payslips bank or building society statements or building society pass books and evidence of any absences referred to in paragraph 306 above the evidence that may be required is specified in paragraph

salary may be paid in the uk or abroad where the migrant will be paid abroad in a currency other than pounds sterling the salary entered on the certificate of sponsorship (cos) must be based on the exchange rate for the relevant currency on the day the cos is assigned taken from the rates published on oanda we take account of basic pay excluding overtime allowances and guaranteed bonuses allowances can include payments to cover extra costs of living whilst in the uk but cannot include o benefits such as overtime bonus or incentive pay which is not guaranteed o employer pension contributions o allowances to cover business expenses including travel between the source country and the uk o the value of any shares which the migrant receives when offered a job under an employee shareholder employment contract page 140 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 accommodation allowances but only up to a maximum of 30 of the total gross salary package this is whether allowances are made available in cash or kind the migrants salary and other (nonaccommodation) allowances must be at least 70 of the maximum package that we take into account this applies only to applications supported by a cos assigned under the tier 2 (ict) longterm staff subcategory below are 2 examples of how longterm staff allowances are worked out example 1 you assign a cos under the longterm staff subcategory the cos details the following figures salary and other (nonaccommodation) allowances total 42000 accommodation allowances total 14000 add these 2 figures together to get the total package offered 56000 we work out the maximum package we can take into account by dividing the salary and other (nonaccommodation) allowances by 70 (07) 42000 07 60000 the total offered is less than the maximum package we can take into account we will therefore take the entire package into account example 2 you assign a cos under the longterm staff subcategory the cos details the following figures salary and other (nonaccommodation) allowances total 24500 accommodation allowances total 21000 add these 2 figures together to get the total package offered 45500 we work out the maximum package we can take into account by dividing the salary and other (nonaccommodation) allowances by 70 (07) 24500 07 35000 the total offered is more than the maximum package we can take into account we will therefore only take into account 35000 which is below the minimum acceptable rate for the tier 2 (ict) longterm staff subcategory so the application will be refused 3016 due to higher costs for short term accommodation where an application is supported by a cos assigned under the tier 2 (ict) graduate trainee subcategory we take account of accommodation allowances up to 40 of the gross salary this means the migrants salary and other (nonaccommodation) allowances must be at least 60 of the maximum package that we will take into account this applies where either page 141 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 the migrant is applying from outside the uk with a cos that has been the migrant is applying for an extension that will take their total stay in the assigned for 12 months or less uk to 12 months or less below is an example of how the tier 2 (ict) graduate trainee allowances are worked out example you assign a cos under the tier 2 (ict) graduate trainee subcategory the cos details the following figures salary and other (nonaccommodation) allowances total 18000 accommodation allowances total 10000 add these 2 figures together to get the total package offered 28000 we work out the maximum package we can take into account by dividing the salary and other (nonaccommodation) allowances by 60 (06) instead of 70 18000 06 30000 the total package offered is less than the maximum package we can take into account we will therefore take the entire package into account related content contents page 142 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version

include the organisation of missionary activity but should not be mainly administrative or clerical unless filling a senior post a senior post may be one which does not involve the migrant doing fieldwork themselves but where they will be supervising staff andor coordinating the organisation of missionary work they may also be in charge of activity such as accounts finance personnel management or it working fulltime as a teacher in a school run by a church or missionary organisation does not count as missionary work but translating religious texts does 315 the work of a member of a religious order must be within the order itself or outside work directed by the order teachers working in schools not maintained by their order must be sponsored under tier 2 (general) novices whose training is taking part in the daily community life of their order can be sponsored under this category but anyone studying for a qualification on a formal fulltime course or training in an academic institution not maintained by the order should be sponsored under tier 4 people who are not members of a religious order but who are working or studying within such a community are not allowed to apply under this category they must be sponsored under the relevant work or study category if they can meet all of the requirements page 143 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 nan

filled by anyone else one example might be where the migrant offers pastoral support to members of a church community as part of their own development but the work would stop if they were not there and you wouldnt replace them migrant will mainly live within and be a member of a religious order for example an order of nuns or monks a religious order is defined for our purposes as a lineage of communities or of people who live in some way set apart from society in accordance with their specific religious devotion and which must be part of a bona fide religious organisation see the tier 2

clergyman responsible for leading regular worship or for the pastoral needs of their own or the wider community if that person left but those duties still existed and you had to find someone to replace them the role is not supernumerary page 144 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 a teacher in a school or college maintained by a religious organisation if that person left but classes they taught had to continue the role is not supernumerary 3111 you must justify that a role is supernumerary when assigning a cos for a supernumerary role you must fully explain in the details of labour market test box (tier 2) or by adding a sponsor note (tier 5) why the role is supernumerary stating the role is supernumerary is not enough you must explain why also if the migrant mainly lives within a religious order you must say this to justify why a resident labour market test is not applicable if there is no explanation or we are not sure about any explanation you have given we may ask you for more information and it is possible that the migrants application for leave may be refused advertising the role to meet the resident labour market test requirements 3112 where a role is not supernumerary or does not involve living within and being a member of a religious order a national recruitment search must always be undertaken we call this a resident labour market test you must carry out a resident labour market test to make sure that you are not denying or displacing a settled worker by filling the role with a migrant 3113 the role must be advertised for a minimum of 28 days in a national media appropriate to your religion or denomination for example a magazine or newspaper such as the church times the catholic herald the jewish chronicle any publication must be available throughout the uk or throughout whichever part of the uk the role is situated for example for a role in glasgow the publication used must be available throughout scotland media only available in a local area is not acceptable for example a local or countywide evening newspaper 3114 if there is no suitable national form of media for your religion you can advertise online either through the find a job service (or in northern ireland jobcentre online) or the employment section of a national newspaper a national newspaper is one published at least once a week and is marketed throughout the uk or throughout the devolved nation in which the job is located this could be the scotsman and the herald which are acceptable for jobs in scotland the western mail for jobs in wales

normally advertise vacant positions if you do advertise on your own website the pages containing the advertisement must be free to view if your website requires people to pay a fee or make a donation to be able to view an advertisement for a vacant role this does not meet our requirements so you must also advertise in some other form of national media as described in this section 3116 where the

migrant may meet all of the tier 5 criteria where there is no direct employeremployee relationship even though an employeremployee relationship may not exist there must be a sponsor who is able and willing to take responsibility for them and meet all of the duties associated with being their sponsor if you are taking on this role you will be responsible for the migrants you sponsor even if you are not their employer below are 3 examples of where the sponsor is not the direct employer page 150 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 example 1 in parts of the arts and entertainments sector a migrant may be employed through an entity such as a special purpose vehicle if this is the case we expect the sponsor to be a producer coproducer or general management company even though they do not directly employ the migrant example 2 where a musical group or theatre troupe and their support entourage is on tour in the uk temporarily they will not usually be employees of the sponsor example 3 there will be occasions within the tier 5 (temporary worker) government authorised exchange subcategory where an overarching sponsor must administer schemes but cannot be the direct employer of any migrants it sponsors to participate in its scheme 337 where a migrant is not your direct employee we will look closely at your arrangements and monitor you to make sure that you are fulfilling your sponsor duties we will take action against you if you are not fulfilling all your sponsorship duties 338 when you assign a cos to a migrant under any subcategory of tier 5 the gross salary figure on the cos must represent what you will ensure the migrant is paid gross of any tax paid whether paid in the uk or overseas and must include any permissible allowances and guaranteed bonuses the total of all allowances and guaranteed bonuses paid and included in that figure should be entered in the gross allowances box on the cos then broken down and detailed in the free text box that follows codes of practice standard occupational classification codes 339 when you assign a cos you must choose the standard occupational classification (soc) code which contains the job description that best matches the role you want to recruit for appendix j to the immigration rules contains information about each soc code and sample job titles and duties that fit within each code you should be able to find the correct soc code by searching appendix j for job titles or key words you may find that if you search for job titles the soc code containing that job title does not match the duties that the migrant will perform this is because different employers use the same job title to describe different jobs or use generic job titles that cover several different jobs if this happens you should search further for example using key words for a job description that matches the migrants duties related content contents page 151 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors

role in question all cos assigned to migrants in the tier 5 (temporary worker) creative and sporting category as a sportsperson must be sponsored in either of the following soc codes 3441 sports

appropriate sports governing body this confirms that they meet the governing body endorsement requirements as agreed between us and them and confirms that as a player or coach they are internationally established at the highest level andor will make a significant contribution to the development of their sport in the uk 3416 when you assign a cos to a sports person under the sporting provisions of tier 5 you must enter their governing body endorsement reference number in the relevant box on the cos you must ensure that the sports person has an electronic copy of their endorsement to print out and provide with their visa application 3417 a migrant who has already been granted leave under tier 5 for a job as a footballer may change (switch) into tier 2 (sportsperson) if they will still be employed as a footballer and can meet the tier 2 (sportsperson) migrant requirements 3418 when you assign a cos in the creative or sporting sector you are guaranteeing that the migrant is seeking entry to the uk to work or perform in the relevant sector is not intending to establish a business in the uk poses no threat to the resident labour market page 155 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 will comply with the conditions (rules) of their permission to stay and where they have been granted leave under tier 5 will leave the uk when it expires 3419 migrants sponsored under the tier 5 (temporary worker) category must normally have been granted entry clearance (a visa) before coming to the uk the only exception is for nonvisa nationals in the tier 5 (temporary worker) creative and sporting subcategory who are seeking entry for no more than 3 months under paragraph 245zn(b) in part 6a of the immigration rules 3420 a nonvisa national means someone who is not a national of a country or territory specified in appendix 2 to appendix v of the immigration rules (whose nationals always require visas to come to the uk) this concession does not apply to visa nationals 3421 there are arrangements at the uk border to allow nonvisa nationals to gain entry to the uk under this concession they must present their cos number to the immigration officer and any evidence for the points they are claiming we recommend you make sure that when assigning a cos migrants understand these arrangements and that leave to enter may take a little longer to process due to the checks that border force staff must carry out we recommend that your sponsored migrants have your contact details in case they need to contact you 3422 if you are sponsoring a nonvisa national to come to the uk under this concession you need to be aware that on entry to the uk they will be subject to the general grounds for refusal in part 9 (paragraphs 320 and 321a) of the immigration rules this means that even if they might otherwise qualify for entry there may be other reasons such as their previous conduct that may lead to the application being refused nonvisa nationals may apply for entry clearance in advance of travel if there is any concern their entry will be delayed or prevented 3423 since 20 may 2019 nationals of seven countries (australia canada japan new zealand singapore south korea and the united states) have been able to use epassport gates (egates) to enter the uk if they are coming as visitors or hold a valid uk entry clearance (visa) prior to their arrival 3424 however those coming to the uk under the tier 5 creative and sporting visa concession are not able to benefit from this change this is because an individual who enters the uk through an egate will not have their cos activated and will not be granted the right type of leave to enter to allow them to work 3425 you must therefore advise individuals whom you are sponsoring under this concession that they must see an immigration officer at a manned desk and that they must not seek to enter the uk through an egate if they mistakenly page 156 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 use an egate they will need to leave the common travel area and reenter the uk making sure that they see an immigration officer in order to have their cos activated and obtain the correct form of leave note the common travel area is the uk ireland the isle of man and the channel islands (bailiwick of guernsey and bailiwick of jersey) 3426 if a nonvisa national who would otherwise qualify under this concession will be entering the uk via ireland they must either apply to be granted leave to enter remotely (using the remote clearance process) or obtain a uk visa in advance of their arrival in the uk this is because individuals travelling from ireland to the uk will not necessarily encounter an immigration officer to endorse the correct form of leave to permit entry under this concession further information can be found in the common travel area guidance on govuk 3427 the option to request leave to enter remotely is only available if the migrant will enter ireland from outside the common travel area (cta) and then proceed directly to the uk they must apply (or you as their sponsor must apply on their behalf) for remote clearance at least 72 hours before they enter the uk if they enter the uk before they have been granted remote clearance they will not have permission to work and must leave the cta they will then need to seek readmission to the uk making sure that they either see an immigration officer on arrival (if reentering the uk from outside the cta) or apply for remote clearance at least 72 hours before arriving in the uk (if they will reenter ireland from outside the cta before returning to the uk) 3428 the option to request leave to enter remotely is not available if the individual will commence a contract of employment which because of the nature of that employment would require their employer to undertake right to work checks this is because remote clearance would not provide the employer with a statutory excuse under illegal working legislation in such cases the migrant must obtain a uk visa before entering through ireland for further information on preventing illegal working see right to work checks an employers guide on govuk 3429 where a nonvisa national is granted leave to enter under this concession their leave will lapse (end) as soon as they leave the common travel area this means that they will not automatically be able to reenter the uk on the basis of their original leave 3430 we understand that the migrant may need to come back to the uk to fulfil their engagements in these circumstances the migrant must give an immigration officer their original cos number again on arrival at the uk border an immigration officer will ask the migrant to give evidence of meeting the page 157 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 maintenance requirements again they will carry out checks to make sure that you have not withdrawn your sponsorship since the migrants original entry we may speak to you again to confirm the details on the cos if the migrant meets all the criteria we will be able to grant leave to allow them to finish the engagements for their sponsor within the period of their original grant

category and now wishes to apply again under tier 2 403 while the coolingoff period applies a migrant who was previously sponsored in any tier 2 category cannot be granted any further entry clearance

for sponsors version 0720 406 if the migrants previous grant of leave was curtailed for any reason the coolingoff period starts from the day after their curtailed period of leave expired 407 where the migrant left the uk before their last period of leave in a relevant category expired the coolingoff period can start earlier than the date their leave expired but only if they can give us evidence of them having not been in the uk with leave in a relevant category for a period before that date evidence may include but is not limited to travel tickets or boarding card stubs but only if you or the

for migrants and appendix c to the immigration rules 4011 if your licence is rated a a (premium) or a (sme+) you can certify maintenance for any migrant sponsored under the tier 2 or tier 5 categories you can also certify maintenance for dependants of any tier 2 or tier 5 migrants 4012 if you want to certify maintenance for a migrant and their dependants under the tier 2 or tier 5 categories you should tick the box on their cos if you do not wish to certify maintenance for dependants you must add a sponsor note on the cos saying this if you certify maintenance under the tier 2 or tier 5 categories you confirm that you will if needed maintain and accommodate the migrant up to the end of their first month of employment in the uk you may limit the amount of the undertaking but any limit must be at least 945 if you certify maintenance for a tier 2 or tier 5 migrants dependants you confirm that you will maintain and accommodate them for the first month of any leave that is granted to them you may limit this but it must be at least 630 per dependant 4013 if you certify maintenance you must make sure the migrants are aware that they must not claim state benefits if they do claim state benefits with your knowledge we will take action against you 4014 if you do not wish to certify maintenance at all the migrant and their dependants must all meet the maintenance requirements as set out in the relevant guidance and the immigration rules and give us the required evidence with their application for leave 4015 switching is the term we use when a migrant who is already legally in the uk moves from one immigration status to another we only approve an application for a migrant to switch immigration category while in the uk if they page 175 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 meet the requirements of the immigration rules to be allowed to stay in the uk within the category that are applying to switch into are already in the uk within one category that allows them to switch into the category they are applying to switch into 4016 if you want to sponsor a migrant under the tier 2 or tier 5 categories who is already in the uk under another immigration category you should check that their current immigration status allows them to switch into the tier 2 or tier 5 category this is important if the migrant is in the uk as the dependant of another migrant this is because any dependant switching into tier 2 (general) counts towards the annual limit under tier 2 (general) which means they will need a restricted cos the tier 2 (general) annual limit section has more information on this 4017 further guidance on switching rules is available in the work visa guidance and part 6a of the immigration rules on govuk 4018 a migrant with leave under the tier 2 or tier 5 categories can apply for an extension of their permission to stay which is known as further leave to remain 4019 where the migrant is already working for you and wishes to extend their period of leave for example if their contract is extended you must assign a new cos for the extended period under the tier 2 and tier 5 categories the requirements for extension applications are that the migrant has been assigned a cos for their continued employment in the same role before making an application for an extension of stay if the migrants original cos was assigned before 6 april 2013 and the job they have been doing is not contained in one of the soc 2010 codes listed in table 7 of appendix j to the immigration rules you can assign a cos under the most appropriate soc 2010 code but only if it is clear that the job the migrant is doing did fit in the soc stated on their original cos and does not fit in one of the transition socs or the migrant has been assigned a cos for their continued employment in another role within the same soc code that was on their original cos before making an application for an extension of stay and the job is still at the appropriate skill level (see transitional arrangements for soc codes skill level for transitional arrangements in respect of changes to the soc codes from 6 april 2013 that may have led to the skill level of a particular job being assessed as lower than before) the migrant will continue to be paid at or above the appropriate rate the rates of pay section has more information on when the experienced rate must be paid to a tier 2 migrant in the case of a private servant sponsored under tier 5 (temporary worker) international agreement that they will continue to work for the employer named on their original cos page 176 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 4020 if you originally carried out a resident labour market test before you started sponsoring the migrant you do not have to do another one 4021 we only extend a migrants permission to stay up to the maximum time allowed under the relevant tier andor subcategory 4022 when you assign a cos to extend a migrants leave in the same tier and category the start date on the cos should be the day after their current leave expires but the migrant cannot apply for leave more than 3 months before that date 4023 if a migrant sponsored under the tier 2 or tier 5 categories changes employer where the conditions (rules) of leave allow this they must make a new application supported by a cos from their new sponsor the exception is if they are moving to a new sponsor with the transfer of undertakings (protection of employment) regulations 2006 (tupe) arrangements or similar protection to continue in the same job due to a takeover merger or demerger or other circumstance in which tupe is triggered 4024 where either you are already sponsoring a migrant who wants to continue working for you in a new job within the same soc code quoted on their cos or a migrant is transferring to you with tupe or similar protection and as part of the transfer they move into a new job within the same soc code that was on the cos assigned to them by their last sponsor they do not have to make a new application unless they are changing from a job which is in a short occupation listed in appendix k to the immigration rules to one that is not in all cases the rate of pay for their new job must meet the appropriate rate requirements set out in this guidance 4025 if a sponsored migrant is changing occupations and will still be employed by you but their new job is in a different soc code they must make a new application the same applies where a migrant is affected by tupe or similar protection and as part of their transfer they change occupation and the new job is in a different soc code 4026 the exception is where the migrant is sponsored in a graduate training programme they may change occupation within the programme or at the end of the programme without you needing to carry out a further resident labour market test or for them to make a new application you must tell us of the change of occupation via the sms 4027 where a sponsored migrant must make a change of employment application you must first carry out a resident labour market test if this guidance requires it before you assign a new cos to them this could be if a migrant you are already sponsoring under tier 2 (general) wants to continue working for you but in a different occupation which is in a different soc code to the one you page 177 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 quoted on their original cos you cannot simply give them the job and assign a new cos to them straight away unless there is an exemption from the resident labour market test 4028 if the new job is not exempt from the resident labour market test you must carry one out and must only appoint that same migrant if no suitable settled workers are available to fill the post if you fail to carry out a resident labour market test in accordance with this guidance we will take action against you 4029 if you assign a cos to a migrant to change employment they must then make a new application their application must be approved before they can start work in their new job this applies in all cases whether the new job is with the same sponsor or a new sponsor the migrant can continue working in their original job for their original sponsor provided their last grant of leave has not expired until the start date of the new job as stated on their new cos 4030 if you sponsor a migrant under tier 2 who is already in the uk under tier 2 having been sponsored by someone else you need to know about the rules that limit a migrant to a maximum of 6 continuous years leave in the uk under tier 2 these rules are explained in the guidance for tier 2 migrants and in part 6a of the immigration rules transitional arrangements for changes of job within the same standard occupation classification code 4031 if you sponsor a migrant whose original certificate of sponsorship (cos) was assigned before 6 april 2013 using a soc 2000 code and you want to move them to a new job that used to be in the same soc code as the one on their cos they will not have to make a change of employment application if the new job falls within one of the equivalent soc 2010 codes you can check this by looking at table 7 in appendix j to the immigration rules which lists the transition from soc 2000 to soc 2010 codes for example if the migrants original job fell within soc 1123 managers in mining and energy and their new job falls within either soc 1123 production managers and directors in mining and energy soc 2424 business and financial project management professionals they will not have to make a change of employment application leaving and returning to the uk 4032 if a tier 2 or tier 5 migrant needs to travel in and out of the uk on a regular basis in connection with their job you can choose to tick the multiple entry box when assigning their cos if you do this it does not involve any extra benefits or restrictions on the migrants ability to travel but does help to show their intentions and likely travel plans to us multiple entry cos holders must like other applicants obtain prior entry clearance unless seeking entry for no more than 3 months as a nonvisa national under the tier 5 creative and page 178 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 nan 4032 if a tier 2 or tier 5 migrant needs to travel in and out of the uk on a regular basis in connection with their job you can choose to tick the multiple entry box when assigning their cos if you do this it does not involve any extra benefits or restrictions on the migrants ability to travel but does help to show their intentions and likely travel plans to us multiple entry cos holders must like other applicants obtain prior entry clearance unless seeking entry for no more than 3 months as a nonvisa national under the tier 5 creative and page 178 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 sporting visa concession 4033 a multipleentry cos is not needed by a migrant wanting to travel overseas for leisure or domestic purposes during the period you sponsor them if they take annual leave and return home during that period they can still return to the uk to resume work if their leave is still valid 4034 if a migrant has been assigned a multiple entry cos this does not override the rules on periods of unpaid leave see the unpaid leave and reductions in salary section for more information on this 4035 if a tier 2 or tier 5 migrant has been granted leave to remain in the uk for 6 months or less or they are a tier 5 migrant who was granted leave to enter under the tier 5 creative and sporting visa concession their leave will end (lapse) if they leave the common travel area (cta) the cta is the uk ireland the isle of man and the channel islands (bailiwick of guernsey and bailiwick of jersey) 4036 if a tier 2 or tier 5 migrants leave lapses as a result of leaving the cta or otherwise expires while they are outside the uk they will not be able to reenter the uk unless they make a further successful application for entry clearance which must be supported by a new cos the migrant may also be affected by the coolingoff period the exception to this is where they are a nonvisa national who entered the uk under the tier 5 creative and sporting visa concession and they are returning under that concession to complete the engagements stated on their original cos 4037 migrants applying for entry clearance to the uk for more than 6 months must apply for a biometric residence permit (brp) as part of the application process this involves enrolling their fingerprints and facial image to have their identity confirmed if a successful decision is made on their application for entry clearance a decision letter will tell the migrant from which nominated post office in the uk they must collect their brp they will be provided with a shortterm biometric entry clearance (a vignette in their passport) valid for 30 days in order to travel to the uk to collect their brp the migrant then has 10 days from their arrival in the uk to collect their brp from that nominated post office the brp will be the sole way of evidencing that the migrant is here lawfully and any conditions (rules) of their leave the biometric residence permits page on govuk has more information 4038 tier 2 and tier 5 migrants applying for leave to remain in the uk have to apply for a brp before receiving the brp the migrant must give their fingerprints and facial image have their identity confirmed and a successful decision made on their application for leave 4039 the vast majority of tier 2 or tier 5 migrants will use their brp to evidence their right to work in the uk if they need to start work before collecting their brp however they will be able to evidence their right to work by producing the shortterm biometric entry clearance in their passport which they used to page 179 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 travel to the uk as long as it is still current in these circumstances you will need to ask to see their brp when this vignette expires (30 days after issue) the right to work checks an employers guide page on govuk has information on how to establish an excuse against a civil penalty liability for employing an illegal worker 4040 those coming to live in the uk for more than 6 months will be required under the brp regulations to collect their brp within 10 days of arrival 4041 where a migrant is working on a contract basis and is being supplied to one organisation by another organisation their sponsor must be whoever has full responsibility for all the duties functions and outcomes or outputs of the job the migrant is doing below is an example of this example company a has a contractual obligation with a client company z to deliver an it solution within an agreed period of time a migrant who is sponsored by company a to do a job on the it project may be sent to work for the length of the contract at company zs premises but they remain employed by company a throughout the whole period of the contract as company a is fully responsible for all the migrants duties functions outputs or outcomes company a must be the migrants sponsor 4042 you can only assign a cos if you have genuine responsibility for deciding all the duties functions and outcomes or outputs of the job the migrant will be doing where the migrant is employed by you to do work for another organisation to fulfil a contractual obligation on your behalf they must be contracted by you to provide a service or project within a certain period of time this means a service or project which has a specific end date after which it will have ended or the service provided will no longer be operated by you or anyone else they must not be agency workers hired to another organisation to fill a position with them whether temporary or permanent regardless of any genuine contract between you and any employment agency or third party (intermediary) who supplies workers to an organisation the employment agencies and employment businesses section has more information contracted to undertake an ongoing routine role or to provide an ongoing routine service for the third party (intermediary) regardless of the length of any genuine contract between you and another organisation 4043 if the migrant is selfemployed there must be a genuine contract for employmentservices between you and the migrant this contract must show the names and signatures of all involved (normally you and the migrant) the start and end dates of the contract page 180 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 details of the job or piece of work the migrant has been contracted to do an indication of how much the migrant will be paid 4044 where we think that you are supplying a migrant to another organisation as labour we may ask for confirmation from the other organisation that the migrant works independently from them and you as the sponsor have full control over all their duties functions outputs or outcomes the migrant is not being supplied to them to undertake a routine role if we find this has happened we will take action against you 4045 migrants sponsored under the tier 2 and tier 5 categories are allowed in limited circumstances to undertake other work as well as that which their cos was assigned for we call this supplementary employment the exception is for private servants sponsored under the tier 5 (temporary worker) international agreement subcategory who are not allowed to take supplementary employment 4046 supplementary employment does not have to meet the resident labour market test requirements and the employer does not have to be a licensed sponsor be in the same profession and at the same professional level as the work for which the migrants cos was assigned or be a job which is in a shortage occupation listed in appendix k to the immigration rules if the occupation is later removed from the list of shortage occupations the migrant must finish that employment be for no more than 20 hours a week be outside of the normal working hours for which the migrants cos was assigned migrants do not need to advise us of any supplementary employment they undertake as long as it meets these criteria 4047 a migrant should advise their new employer that the employment is supplementary to the work they are being sponsored to do so that their supplementary employer can make the necessary checks described in our guidance for employers on illegal working the right to work checks an employers guide page on govuk has more information 4048 once a migrant sponsored under tier 2 has used their cos to gain leave to enter or remain in the uk and has started work they are allowed to apply to take other employment which does not meet the supplementary employment criteria we call this secondary employment page 181 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 4049 any secondary employment must be with a licensed sponsor and the migrant must be able to meet the criteria relevant to the category in which their secondary employment falls the secondary employer must have recruited them in line with the rules set out in this guidance the secondary employer must assign a new cos to the migrant so that they can make an application to vary their existing leave or worker authorisation note a second cos cannot be assigned to a migrant until the migrant has used their first one 4050 migrants sponsored under tier 2 and tier 5 may do courses of study there is no limit on the number of hours they can study or level of course they undertake however we would expect that any study done does not affect their ability to carry out the job they have been employed to do if they intend to study a discipline listed in appendix 6 to the immigration rules and are 18 years of age or over they must obtain an academic technology approval scheme (atas) clearance certificate in respect of this course from the counterproliferation department of the foreign and commonwealth office prior to commencing their study study may be undertaken anywhere the migrant chooses and does not have to be with a licensed tier 4 sponsor what happens if a migrant applies for settlement (also called indefinite leave to remain) 4051 the maximum time that a tier 2 migrant may be in the uk under the tier 2 (general) tier 2 (minister of religion) or tier 2 (sportsperson) categories is 6 years after 5 years the migrant may apply for settlement (also called indefinite leave to remain (ilr)) in the uk 4052 if a tier 2 migrant applies for ilr as a tier 2 migrant you will need to support this application with evidence this is currently a letter confirming the migrant is still wanted for the same job and will be needed for the foreseeable future absences of the person from the uk the periods and purposes of workrelated absences and their periods of annual leave amount of the migrants salary and that this is their regular salary you will also need to confirm that the salary is not expected to reduce once they have been granted ilr and that the salary is at or above the appropriate rate we may check this during a compliance visit page 182 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan nan on 19 february 2020 the government published a policy statement setting out the highlevel details of the uks pointsbased immigration system these new arrangements will start operating from 1 january 2021 once freedom of movement with the european union (eu) has ended it will provide for a single system for eu and noneu citizens alike and aims to attract people who can contribute to the uks economy irish citizens will continue to be able to enter and live in the uk as they do now the new pointsbased system will include a route for skilled workers who have a job offer from an approved employer (sponsor) this will replace the existing tier 2 (general) route from 1 january 2021 the job will need to be at a required skill level of level 3 or above on the regulated qualifications framework (rqf) or the equivalent level in wales or scotland this is approximately equivalent to alevel standard the migrant will need to be able to speak english the minimum general salary threshold will be reduced from 30000 to 25600 (with lower salaries in certain circumstances such as new entrants to the labour market) an individual migrant may be able to trade certain characteristics against the salary that they would otherwise be required to earn for the occupation in question further information on how the new pointsbased system will work are in the policy statement if you are not currently approved to be a sponsor but think that you are likely to need to sponsor skilled migrant workers from 1 january 2021 you can apply for approval (a sponsor licence) now you will need to show that you will be able to offer genuine employment skilled to level rqf3 or above details of which jobs are currently considered to be rqf3 or above are contained in appendix j to the immigration rules you should note that this list is subject to change and jobs that are currently considered to be rqf3 may not be when the new system goes live further information on this will be provided later in the year you must meet all of the requirements set out in this guidance except the current requirement to offer employment at rqf6 or above you are strongly advised to read all parts of the sponsor guidance for employers including relevant appendices before you apply these are available on the sponsorship policy guidance page on govuk page 207 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 to apply you must complete the online application form on govuk and provide the mandatory documents specified in appendix a to the sponsor guidance on your application form you should provide as much information as you can on how many migrant workers you are likely to employ during the first year of your licence including any you wish to sponsor at rqf level 3 and above from 1 january 2021 this will determine your allocation of certificates of sponsorship (cos) if your application is approved a cos is an electronic record that you will need to assign to a migrant before they can apply for entry clearance (a visa) to or leave to remain in the uk you are encouraged to apply early even if you are not currently in a position to sponsor migrants under the existing system or are not sure if or when you will need sponsor migrants under the new system from january 2021 in such cases provided you meet all of the other requirements set out in this guidance we can grant you a licence but will not allocate any cos to you at this stage once you know that you will need to appoint migrant workers you can request the number of cos you need guidance on how to do this is contained in sponsorship management system (sms) manual 2 in the section entitled how to request and withdraw a request for a coscas allocation increase if your application for a sponsor licence is approved you should note that you will not at the current time be able to assign any cos to sponsor migrants for jobs at rqf levels 3 to 5 unless an exception to the current skill level requirement set out in this guidance applies see assigning a cos for rqf level 3 to 5 jobs below for further information any migrant sponsored to undertake a job at rqf levels 3 to 5 must not apply for entry clearance or leave to remain until the new pointsbased system comes into effect unless an exception to the current skill level requirment set out in this guidance applies if they do their application will be refused and we may take compliance action against you the list of jobs currently considered to be rqf3 or above may change before the new system comes into effect a cos for jobs for eu eea or swiss migrants at rqf level 6 or above is only required where those migrants are applying to come to the uk on or after 1 january 2021 if you are not allocated any cos you can apply for an increase to your cos allocation when you know that you will need to appoint a migrant worker if your application is approved you will not be able to assign any cos to sponsor migrants at rqf levels 3 to 5 yet unless the job is covered by one of the current skilllevel exceptions page 208 of 209 tiers 2 and 5 guidance for sponsors version 0720 we intend to start accepting applications under the new pointsbased system from autumn 2020 we will provide further detail on govuk over the coming months and will update this guidance as soon as possible to confirm the earliest date you can assign cos for use under the new system migrants can apply for entry clearance or leave to remain under the new system you can assign any cos you have been allocated under the current tier 2 (general) arrangements as soon as you need to provided the job meets the current skilllevel and all other relevant requirements if we are not satisfied that you can offer genuine employment at rqf level 3 or above or you do not otherwise meet the requirements set out in this guidance we will refuse your application if your application is refused we will not refund your application fee and you will not be eligible to apply again for at least 6 months (longer in some cases) see sections 7 8 and 9 of this guidance for information on how we consider applications and section 10 for information on coolingoff periods if we refuse your application govuk website as it becomes available we will also update this guidance as the new system develops you can also sign up for email updates on the new
