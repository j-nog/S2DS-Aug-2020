Tier 2 and 5: Guidance for Sponsors - Addendum ..................................................... 1 
"
1,About this guidance,"This guidance is for organisations who want to apply for a sponsor licence to 
sponsor migrants under Tier 2 and/or Tier 5 of the points-based system. It 
tells you what we expect if you are a licence holder, the processes you must 
follow when sponsoring a migrant and how to meet all of the duties and 
responsibilities associated with being a licensed sponsor. The guidance is 
subject to change and you should check the dates to make sure you have 
the latest version. 
 
A new points-based immigration system will come into effect from 1 January 
2021. The future system will apply to both European Economic Area (EEA) 
nationals and non-EEA nationals. You should refer to Annex 9 of this 
guidance if you intend to apply for a licence to sponsor workers under the 
new system.  
 
Separate guidance exists on GOV.UK for UK education providers who wish 
to apply for and hold a licence to sponsor international students to come to 
the UK under Tier 4 to study. 
 
You can find the appendices mentioned in this guidance under sponsorship policy 
guidance on the ‘Guidance for employers and educators' page on GOV.UK.

5,Migrant information,"If you intend to sponsor migrants under Tier 2 or Tier 5, you may need to check how 
much time they may be allowed to spend in the UK and any other restrictions that

(General), can be found in ‘Using the sponsorship management system (SMS):

"
7,Using a representative,"A representative is a:  
 
•  person who is qualified to provide immigration advice or services in accordance 
with section 84 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (as amended from time 
to time) by being:  
o  regulated by the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC)  
o  exempt by ministerial order from the requirement to be regulated 
o  otherwise compliant with section 84 
•  regulated member of a designated professional body or designated qualifying 
regulator, or working under the supervision of such a person – for the purposes 
of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, the designated bodies and regulators 
are the: 
o  Legal Services Board (which has oversight of the Law Society, the 
Chartered Institute of Legal Executives, and the Bar Council) 
o  Law Society of Scotland 
o  Law Society of Northern Ireland 
o  Bar Council of Northern Ireland 
o  Faculty of Advocates 
 
You can use the services of a representative to act on your behalf. A representative 
must meet our definition above and be based in the UK.  
 
If they act on your behalf without being ‘qualified’ under the Immigration and Asylum 
Act 1999, they may be committing a criminal offence.  
 
Anyone compliant with section 84 through exemption by ministerial order still has to 
comply with the OISC code of standards.  
 
The ‘Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC)’ page on GOV.UK has 
more information and links to websites for solicitors, advocates, barristers, legal 
executives and the Community Legal Service.

1  Applying for a licence 
 
What is sponsorship? 
1. 
Tiers 2 and 5 of the points-based system are the primary immigration routes 
for non-European Economic Area (EEA) migrants who wish to work in the UK. 
These migrants must be sponsored by an organisation or company that holds 
a Tier 2 and/or Tier 5 licence. A licence is a permission given to an 
organisation to sponsor workers in its business. The organisation is known as 
a sponsor. Individual persons are not recognised as sponsors.  
Note: a new points-based immigration system will come into effect from 1 
January 2021. This new system will apply to both EEA and non-EEA workers. 
If you intend to sponsor migrant workers under this new system, you should 
refer to Annex 9 of this guidance. 
 
1.1  Sponsorship is based on 2 principles: 
 
•  those who benefit most directly from migration; employers, education 
providers or other bodies who are bringing in migrants, should play their 
part in ensuring the system is not abused 
•  we need to make sure that those applying to come to the UK for work or to 
study are eligible and that a reputable employer or education provider 
genuinely wishes to take them on 
1.2  A migrant must have a sponsor before they can apply to come to, or remain in, 
the UK for work.  
 
1.3  Sponsorship plays 2 main roles in a migrant’s application for permission to 
come to, or remain in, the UK to work: 
 
•  where appropriate, it provides evidence that the migrant will fill a genuine 
vacancy that cannot be filled with a suitably qualified or skilled settled 
worker 
•  it involves a pledge from the sponsor that it accepts all of the duties 
expected when sponsoring the migrant 
1.4  When a sponsor is granted a Tier 2 or Tier 5 licence, significant trust is placed 
in them. With this trust comes a responsibility to act in accordance with the 
Immigration Rules and all parts of the Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors. 
We have a duty to ensure that all sponsors discharge these responsibilities 
and will take compliance action when it is considered that a sponsor has failed 
to do so, or otherwise poses a risk to immigration control. The ‘Sponsor duties’ 
section has more information on the duties sponsors must fulfil.  
 
1.5  When considering your licence application, we need to establish 4 things:

Page 16 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  are you a genuine organisation operating lawfully in the UK? - to prove 
this, you must provide certain documents - these are listed in Appendix A 
of the guidance for sponsors 
•  are you honest, dependable and reliable? - to judge this, we look at your 
history and background, the key personnel named on your application and 
any people involved in your day to day running 
•  are you capable of carrying out your sponsor duties and evidencing your 
compliance in a timeframe and manner set out in the ‘Sponsor duties’ 
section? - we judge this by looking at your current human resources and 
recruitment practices to make sure that you will be able to fulfil your 
sponsor duties, we may do this by visiting you before your licence is 
granted 
•  if you are applying under Tier 2 (General), can you offer genuine 
employment that meets the Tier 2 (General) skill level and appropriate 
rates of pay? - the skill threshold for Tier 2 (General) employment 
currently requires a role to be at or above Regulated Qualifications 
Framework level 6 (graduate level), unless any of the exceptions set out 
under ‘Skill level for jobs under Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra-Company 
Transfer)’ apply 
 
Note: from 1 January 2021, you will be able to sponsor migrants at RQF level 
3 (A-level and equivalent) or above under the new points-based immigration 
system. See Annex 9 of this guidance for further information. 
We may use the information that you provide to us when you apply for a 
licence or at any time throughout the period of your licence in accordance with 
the Home Office Personal Information Charter. In certain circumstances, 
details may be passed to other government departments and agencies, local 
authorities and fraud prevention agencies such as HM Revenue and Customs 
(HMRC), Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and Credit Industry Fraud 
Avoidance System (CIFAS) for immigration purposes, the prevention of fraud 
and criminality and/or to help them carry out their functions. These bodies may 
provide the Home Office with information about you and your employees. 
Further details explaining when information may be passed to other bodies, 
and how that information may be used, is available on GOV.UK.  
 
"
11,Current available immigration routes for workers,"1.6  An organisation can apply for recognition under 2 routes: 
 
•  Tier 2: is for skilled work 
•  Tier 5: is for temporary work or an exchange scheme 
 
"
12,Tier 2: skilled workers with a job offer,"1.7 
 
There are 4 categories under the Tier 2 route. They are: 
•  Tier 2 (General) – is for workers who have an offer of a skilled job from an 
employer in the UK that cannot be filled by a settled worker and includes 
workers coming to the UK to fill shortage occupations 
Page 17 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
•  Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) – is for an existing employee of a 
multinational employer who needs to be transferred by the overseas 
employer to a UK branch which is linked by common ownership or control; 
for training purposes or to fill a specific vacancy that cannot be filled by a 
settled or EEA worker either on a long-term basis or for frequent short 
visits, there are 2 sub-categories of this category: 
o  Long-term Staff: is for an employee who needs to be transferred to a 
job which cannot be filled by a new UK recruit; they must have worked 
for their employer overseas for at least 12 months (unless they will 
earn at least £73,900 in the UK)  
o  Graduate Trainee: is for an employee who transfers into a graduate 
trainee programme for a specialist role; they must be a recent 
graduate with at least 3 months’ experience with their employer 
overseas 
•  Tier 2 (Sportsperson): is for elite sportspeople and coaches who are 
internationally established at the highest level and whose employment will 
make a significant contribution to the development of their sport at the 
highest level in the UK, and who will base themselves in the UK 
•  Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) religious workers who have an offer of a job 
within a faith community, such as, a minister of religion, missionary, or 
member of a religious order, in the UK 
 
"
13,Tier 5: temporary workers,"1.8 
 
There are 2 categories under the Tier 5 route: 
•  Tier 5 (Temporary Worker): is for workers to work in a variety of temporary 
roles with an organisation in the UK which will help to satisfy cultural, 
charitable, religious or international objectives including volunteering and 
job shadowing, and for meeting seasonal employment needs in the edible 
horticultural sector. There are 6 sub-categories in this category:  
o  Creative and sporting: is for sports people, entertainers or creative 
artists who have been offered work in the UK for up to 12 months  
o  Charity workers: is for voluntary workers who wish to do unpaid work 
for a charity; it does not include those doing paid work for a charity  
o  Religious workers: is for those who want to do religious work, such as 
working in a religious order 
o  Government authorised exchange: is for those who want to come to 
the UK for a short time for work experience or to do training, an 
Overseas Government Language Programme, research or a 
fellowship through an approved government authorised exchange 
scheme  
o  International agreement: is for those contracted to do work covered by 
international law while in the UK, such as, working for a foreign 
government or as a private servant in a diplomatic household 
o  Seasonal workers: this is a pilot route, enabling employers in the 
edible horticulture sector to employ seasonal workers through an 
approved scheme operator for up to 6 months 
•  Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme): is a cultural exchange scheme which aims 
to promote the UK overseas and to encourage trade and tourism - it

allows young people, aged between 18 and 30, to travel to the UK for 
mainly noneconomic reasons, and offers young migrants from 
participating countries and territories, opportunities to work temporarily 
while experiencing life in the UK 
 
"
14,Consequences of employing migrants illegally,"1.9  All employers, not just licensed sponsors, must make sure that their 
employees are entitled to work for them. We will impose a range of penalties 
on those employing people illegally. 
1.10  Compliance officers will refer cases of illegal working for prosecution or the 
issue of a civil penalty. If you are issued with a civil penalty for employing 
illegal workers, your licence may be suspended and any new licence 
application may be refused. ‘Sanctions for illegally employing migrants’ has 
more information on the penalties imposed. We reserve the right to suspend 
your licence or remove your Certification of Sponsorship (CoS) allocation while 
any investigation is in progress. 
 
"
15,Safeguarding children,"1.11  Under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, we 
must have regard to the need to safeguard children and to promote their 
welfare when exercising immigration functions. The administration of the 
sponsor licensing regime supports our immigration functions, whilst not itself 
constituting such a function. We do not consider that section 55 of the 2009 
Act imposes a general duty upon us to consider the welfare of children of 
sponsored migrants when making decisions about licensing. We do think it 
appropriate to ensure that employers make sure suitable care arrangements 
are in place for a child under 18 who will work in the UK. These include 
arrangements for their: 
 
•  travel 
•  reception when they arrive in the UK 
•  arrangements while in the UK, as well as, parental consent to these 
arrangements  
 
1.12 
If you fail to do this, we will revoke your licence.  
 
1.13  You must have a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check on any of your 
workers undertaking a regulated activity for children. The ‘Regulated Activity in 
relation to Children’ page on GOV.UK has information on what constitutes a 
regulated activity. If your sponsored worker requires a check, they must show 
you their certificate of good character or criminal record check. If you require a 
check, you must ensure that it is carried out. The ‘Criminal records check for 
overseas applicants’ page on GOV.UK has information on how to do this. 
 
"
16,Contact point for queries,"1.14 
If you have any queries about the application process, please call us on 0300 
123 4699, or email the Business Helpdesk.

1.15  You can use the services of a representative to help you complete an online 
1.16 
application for a sponsor licence, but they cannot send the application on your 
behalf. If a representative sends your application, it will be refused and your 
fee will not be refunded. 
 
If after receiving a licence, you wish to use the services of a representative, 
you must appoint one using the sponsorship management system (SMS). The 
‘What is the sponsorship management system?’ section has more information 
on the SMS. We will not deal with any communications from a representative 
acting on your behalf unless they have been appointed by you. You can tell us 
that a representative has helped you to fill in your licence application, but you 
can only appoint them at the licence application stage if you also want to 
appoint them as your key contact. We will, however, reject applications where 
you do not have a level 1 user who is your employee. 
 
"
17,Fees,"1.17  There is a fee for: 
 
•  initial applications for a sponsor licence  
•  applying to renew an existing sponsor licence 
•  applying to extend the scope of an existing licence 
•  assigning each certificate of sponsorship (CoS) 
Full payment guidance is available on the ‘UK visa fees’ page on GOV.UK. 
The fee for a sponsor licence depends on the size of the organisation that is 
applying. If you have charitable status or you are subject to the small 
companies regime as set out in paragraphs 381 to 384 of the Companies Act 
2006 on GOV.UK you are eligible to pay the ‘small’ sponsor licence fee.  
This fee is for our consideration of your licence application and will not be 
refunded if we refuse your licence application or you withdraw it after 
consideration of it has begun. 
 
"
18,Immigration skills charge,"1.18  You may have to pay an ‘immigration skills charge’ each time you sponsor a 
migrant in the Tier 2 (General) category or the Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer 
(ICT)) Long-term Staff subcategory. The charge came into force on 6 April 
2017 and the money collected from it will be used to address skills gaps in the 
UK workforce.  
 
1.19  The charge is payable in full each time you assign a certificate of sponsorship 
(CoS). The amount you have to pay is specified in the Schedule to the 
Immigration Skills Charge Regulations 2017 and depends on:  
 
•  the size and type of your organisation on the date you assign the worker’s 
CoS, and  
•  the length of employment stated on the CoS  
Page 20 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
1.20 
If you are a small or charitable sponsor, as defined in regulation 2 of the 
Immigration Skills Charge Regulations, you will pay the ‘small’ charge, that is:  
•  £364 for any stated period of employment up to 12 months, plus  
•  £182 for each subsequent 6-month period stated on the CoS 
In all other cases, you must pay the ‘large’ charge, that is:  
  
1.21 
 
•  £1,000 for any stated period of employment up to 12 months, plus  
•  £500 for each subsequent 6-month period stated on the CoS  
 
1.22  When you apply for a licence, or apply to renew your licence, it is essential 
that you select the correct size or type for your organisation, as this will 
determine not only the licence fee you will pay, but also the level of 
immigration skills charge you will pay throughout the life of your licence, or 
until you tell us of a change of circumstances through the sponsorship 
management system (SMS) and this has been processed and accepted by 
UKVI.  
 
1.23  To comply with your reporting duties, you must tell us as soon as possible – 
and in any case within 10 working days – if the size or type of your 
organisation changes. This will ensure you pay the correct immigration skills 
charge for each CoS you assign. If you fail to inform us within 10 working 
days, we may take compliance action against you. This could include 
downgrading, suspending or revoking your licence. 
 
1.24  You must not pass any of the charge on to the migrant worker. If we find out 
that you have done this, we may revoke your licence.  
 
"
19,When you must pay,"1.25  Unless an exception applies, you must pay the charge each time you assign a 
CoS to a worker from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or 
Switzerland in the Tier 2 (General) category or the Long-term Staff 
subcategory of Tier 2 (ICT) and the worker is either:  
•  applying from outside the UK for entry clearance (a visa) to work in the UK 
•  applying from within the UK for leave to remain of any duration, including 
for 6 months or more, or 
for less than 6 months 
 
"
20,When you don’t have to pay,"1.26  You do not have to pay the charge if you are sponsoring any of the following: 
 
•  a worker who is applying for entry clearance from outside the UK for a 
period of less than 6 months 
•  a worker to do a specified PhD-level occupation listed in Table 1 of 
Appendix J to the Immigration Rules 
•  a worker in the Graduate Trainee subcategory of Tier 2 (ICT) 
•  a worker to whom you have previously assigned a CoS where: 
Page 21 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
o  you assign them a new CoS to work for you in a different standard 
occupational classification (SOC) code, and 
o  the new period of leave they are seeking will not exceed their current 
period of leave – if the application would result in a longer grant of 
leave, you must pay the charge, unless another exemption applies 
•  a migrant who has valid leave as a student and is applying under Tier 2 
(General) or Tier 2 (ICT) Long-term Staff – note that this exemption 
continues to apply if you later assign a further CoS to the same migrant to 
continue in the same role 
•  a worker who was assigned a CoS under Tier 2 (General) or Tier 2 (ICT) 
Long-term Staff before 6 April 2017 and: 
o  that CoS resulted in a grant of entry clearance or leave to remain 
o  the worker undertook the role for which that CoS was assigned, and  
o  the worker has not since ceased to have leave to enter or remain 
under Tier 2 (General) or Tier 2 (ICT) Long-term Staff 
 
1.27  You do not have to pay the skills charge for the worker’s family members 
(‘dependants’) who are not themselves migrant workers in the Tier 2 (General) 
or (ICT) categories. The charge does not apply to any other Tier 2 category or 
any of the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) subcategories.  
 
1.28  There is an Immigration Skills Charge calculator on GOV.UK to help you work 
out if you are liable for the charge.

21,Consequences of non-payment,"1.29  Any CoS you have assigned for which you have not paid the full charge 
(where required) will become and remain invalid until the outstanding charge is 
paid in full. This means that any application for entry clearance or leave to 
remain made on the basis of that CoS will be delayed until the charge is paid 
in full.  
1.30  You will be contacted by UKVI if you have not paid the charge or have not paid 
the full amount when you assigned the CoS. 
1.31  The worker’s application for entry clearance or leave to remain will be refused 
if you don’t pay the full amount within 10 working days of the first formal 
reminder to make the payment.  
"
22,Refunds and ‘top-up’ charges,"1.32  The Secretary of State may refund all or part of the charge. A refund will be 
paid to the debit or credit card the charge was paid with, unless you advise us 
of different payment arrangements. In some cases, we may need to request a 
‘top-up’ charge (that is, request an additional amount from you) if you have not 
paid the full amount that you owe. 
 
Partial refund 
1.33  A partial refund will be made in respect of all whole unused 6-month periods of 
leave after the first year of employment where the worker: 
 
 
 
 
Page 22 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
•  is granted for less than the period requested on the CoS - for example, if a 
5-year visa was applied for, but a 3-year visa is granted, the balance 
(£2,000 or £728 for a small sponsor or charity) would be refunded 
•  starts work for one Tier 2 sponsor, but then voluntarily changes to another 
sponsor – the first sponsor will be paid the difference between the charge 
paid and the charge payable for the length of time the Tier 2 worker has 
worked for the first sponsor, or 
•  leaves their post early – for example, if they return home due to ill health, 
are made redundant or dismissed, fail their probation, or fail to secure a 
necessary professional qualification 
 
1.34  A partial refund will also be made if:  
 
•  you assign a CoS to a migrant and pay the large fee, and 
•  before you assigned that CoS, you had notified us that your company had 
changed from large to small, or gained charitable status, and we have 
verified this information  
 
1.35 
In these circumstances, we will refund the difference between the large fee 
and the small fee. We will only issue refunds in respect of CoS issued on or 
after the date you notified us your change in status. It is therefore important 
you tell us of any change in status as soon as possible.  
 
Full refund 
1.36  A full refund will be paid where the migrant’s application for entry clearance or 
leave to remain is: 
•  refused  
•  withdrawn, or 
•  granted but the migrant does not travel to the UK or start work for the 
sponsor 
1.37  A full refund will also be made if the relevant CoS is not used to make a valid 
application for entry clearance or leave to remain. 
How soon decisions on refunds are made 
1.38  Decisions on refunds, other than those related to a change in size or 
charitable status (see paragraphs 1.34 and 1.35 above), are made within 90 
days of: 
 
•  the date you notified UKVI via the SMS that the migrant didn’t come to the 
UK to start work or has left the relevant employment early 
•  the CoS expiry date if no valid visa application is made by the migrant 
•  the date you notified UKVI that you had withdrawn the CoS 
•  the deadline date for making an administrative review application if the 
migrant’s visa application has been refused and they have not applied for 
an administrative review, or 
•  the migrant’s administrative review being dismissed 
 
 
 
 
Page 23 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
Contact UKVI if your refund hasn’t been paid within 90 days of the relevant 
date. 
 
1.39  Where you have notified us that you now qualify as a small company, or have 
gained charitable status, we will issue any partial refund (where due) once we 
have verified that the information you have provided is correct. 
 
Circumstances in which no refund will be made 
1.40  No refund of the immigration skills charge will be paid where: 
•  the migrant changes job but remains working for the same employer 
•  the migrant changes (‘switches’) from a Tier 2 (General) or Tier 2 (ICT) 
Long-term Staff visa to another immigration route but remains employed in 
the same job 
•  your licence is made ‘dormant’ (for example, following a takeover of your 
company) 
•  your licence is revoked, or 
•  the migrant’s leave is curtailed (shortened), unless the reason for 
curtailment is because the migrant failed to commence the relevant 
employment or finished the employment early – a full or partial refund may 
be paid in these circumstances 
 
Top-up charges 
1.41  We will request additional funds (a top-up charge) if: 
 
•  you assign a CoS to a migrant and pay the small fee, and 
•  before you assigned that CoS, you had notified us that you no longer 
qualify as a small or charitable sponsor, and we have verified this 
information 
 
1.42 
In these circumstances, we will request a top-up charge (the difference 
between the small fee and the large fee) in respect of any CoS you have 
assigned on or after the date you notified us of your change in status.  
 
1.43  We will also request a top-up charge in any case where you do not pay the full 
charge (or any charge) for any other reason. See ‘Consequences of non-
payment’ above for what happens if you fail to pay the charge in full.

2  How does sponsorship work? 
To get a licence, you must apply to us using the online application form and 
supply specified documents to prove that you are suitable and eligible. These 
documents are listed in Appendix A of the guidance for sponsors. 
 
2.1  A sponsor licence is valid for 4 years, after which it will expire. The only 
exceptions are if we revoke it or you surrender it before it expires. We reserve 
the right to take action against you if we have reason to believe you pose 
any risk to immigration control. The 4 years will run from the date your 
licence is granted. 
 
2.2  When we consider your application, we assess whether you meet the 
requirements below. You must: 
 
 
 
 
•  complete and send the online sponsor application - this includes a 
declaration from you that you agree to meet all of the duties associated 
with being a licensed sponsor 
•  pay the correct fee 
•  provide proof you are based in the UK and provide original or certified 
copies of the documents listed in Appendix A, unless we say otherwise, to 
show you are genuine and operating or trading lawfully in the UK; an 
organisation is deemed to have been ‘operating or trading’ in the UK from 
the point at which it was incorporated 
•  meet the eligibility and suitability criteria 
•  if asked, provide evidence of holding the appropriate planning permission 
or Local Planning Authority consent to run your type/class of business at 
your trading address, if consent is required by your Local Authority 
•  where you are a food business, if asked, be able to provide evidence of 
your registration with, or approval from, a relevant food authority 
 
We will also consider any evidence which suggests you may be a threat to 
immigration control, or evidence from a public body of your lack of compliance 
with their rules. 
2.3  When you complete the online sponsor licence application, you must choose 
which tiers, categories and subcategories you wish to be licensed under. You 
can choose as many tiers, categories or subcategories as you need, provided 
you are eligible for them. If your application is successful, these will then be 
the only ones you can sponsor a migrant under. 
Licence applications may be rejected, refused or granted with an A-Rating. 
The ‘Rating sponsors’ section has information about the decision we may 
make on your application. 
If your application for a licence is granted, you will then be able to assign 
certificates of sponsorship (CoS) to migrants who wish to work for you. We will 
decide how many CoS you will be allowed to assign.

23,How does sponsorship work?,
24,How can I apply for a licence?,
25,Applying for a licence: tier specific,
26,Tier 2 (General),"4. 
4  Applying for a licence: tier specific 
To be eligible to sponsor a migrant under the current Tier 2 (General) rules, 
you must be able to offer genuine employment at or above level 6 (graduate 
level) on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF), or the equivalent 
level in Wales or Scotland, unless an exception set out in this guidance 
applies.  
 
From 1 January 2021, you will be able to sponsor European Economic Area 
(EEA) and non-EEA workers at RQF level 3 (A-level or equivalent) and above 
under the new points-based system, specifically under the new Skilled Worker 
route which will replace Tier 2 (General). You may apply for a licence for this 
now, but you will not be able to sponsor anyone below RQF level 6 until the 
new system comes into effect. If you intend to apply for a licence to sponsor 
migrants at RQF level 3 and above from 1 January 2021, refer to Annex 9 of 
this guidance.  
 
Tier 2 (Ministers of Religion) and Tier 5 (Temporary 
Worker) Religious Workers 
4.1 
 
To apply for a licence, you must be a bona fide religious organisation which: 
•  is a registered, excepted or exempt UK charity according to the charity 
legislation in force in your part of the UK, or is an ecclesiastical 
corporation, either corporation sole or body corporate, set up for charitable 
purposes; in Northern Ireland, you must have charitable status for tax 
purposes from HM Revenue and Customs 
Note: if you are a charity which is not registered according to the relevant 
charity legislation, you must tell us the reason for non-registration; the 
charities acts have more information, see: 
o  Charities Act 2011 for England & Wales 
o  Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 
o  Charities Act (Northern Ireland) 2008 
•  is the structure for a faith-based community with a common system of 
belief and spiritual goals, codes of behaviour and religious practice, which 
exists to support and/or propagate common beliefs and practices and 
where beliefs: 
o  include any religious belief or similar philosophical belief in something 
transcendental, metaphysical or ultimate, and 
o  exclude any philosophical or political belief concerned with man, 
unless that belief is similar to religious belief 
•  does not exclude from your community on the basis of gender, nationality 
or ethnicity 
•  receives financial and material support for your core religious ministry from 
your congregation or community on a voluntary basis, without promise or 
coercion  
•  does not breach, or encourage others to breach any UK legislation 
Page 29 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  does not work against the public interest, or have a detrimental effect on 
personal or family life as commonly understood in the UK 
 
"
27,Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer),"4.2 
To sponsor migrants under the Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer (ICT)) 
subcategories, you must show a direct link by common ownership or control 
with the overseas entities from which you will bring migrants to the UK. 
Common ownership or control may be shown by one of the following: 
•  one entity controls the composition of the other entity’s board 
•  one entity can cast, or control the casting of, more than half the maximum 
number of votes at a general meeting of the other entity 
•  one entity holds more than half the issued share capital of the other entity 
(apart from any part of that issued share capital that has no right to take 
part beyond a set amount in a distribution of either profits or capital) 
•  both entities have a common parent entity that itself or through other 
entities meets one or all requirements above about both entities that are 
the subject of the intra-company transfer 
•  one entity is related to the other entity as both are party to a joint venture 
agreement 
•  one entity is related to the other entity in that one is party to a joint venture 
agreement and the other is formed by that joint venture agreement 
•  one entity is related to the other by agreement that would constitute a joint 
venture agreement other than for the fact that joint venture agreements 
are not permitted in the country of operation or one of the entities is not 
permitted to enter into joint ventures in the country of operation 
•  one entity is related to the other in that one entity is party to an agreement 
that would make up a joint venture agreement other than for the fact that 
joint venture agreements are not allowed in the country of operation or 
that entity is not allowed to enter into joint ventures in the country of 
operation and the other entity is the entity formed by that agreement 
•  where both entities are either accountancy or law firms, one entity is 
related to the other by agreement which allows both to use a trademark 
registered or established under UK law and the jurisdiction of the other 
entity’s country of operation 
•  where both entities are either accountancy or law firms, one entity is 
related to the other by agreement which allows both to run under the same 
name in the UK and in the jurisdiction of the other entity’s country of 
operation 
•  in the case of unincorporated associations, we may consider the receiving 
entity to be a linked company if it is a registered company and its Articles 
of Association with the sending entity show a relationship of control, for 
example one member has the power to appoint the other’s trustees 
 
4.3  Where the link between the 2 entities between which the transfer will take 
place is that an individual owns shares in each entity, that individual must have 
a majority shareholding in each entity. You must provide documentary 
evidence of your shareholding in terms of percentages held. 
 
Page 30 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
4.4  Where the link is via a joint venture, we must be sure that there is a genuine 
vacancy for a migrant before we accept that you can sponsor someone under 
the Tier 2 (ICT) provisions. There are many forms of joint venture; we will ask 
you to provide several pieces of evidence to show that the venture is in 
operation.  
 
You should also supply as many of the following as are applicable to your 
circumstances:  
 
•  if a new company has been formed you should provide references from 
Companies House and confirm the entities involved in the joint venture 
together with the owners of the new company 
•  public announcements of the joint venture 
•  a copy of an official letter from the overseas company (or foreign investor) 
to Ministers confirming their intention to invest in the UK, naming the 
entities involved in the joint venture 
•  a copy of the binding contract or partnership agreement, signed 
appropriately, between the entities in the joint venture agreement - this 
must include the names and positions of the signatories, the investment or 
ownership agreement of the enterprise, and timescales and phases of the 
project 
•  if the joint venture has a previous history of working with the Department 
for International Trade (DIT) or the equivalent economic government 
departments in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, we may accept 
evidence via the DIT listing online of the joint venture 
The above is not a complete list and we will ask you for any further evidence 
we need to assess your circumstances. 
We will not accept informal agreements of cooperation as sufficient evidence 
that a genuine vacancy exists for a migrant in the UK. The joint venture must 
already be operating and the vacancy must already exist before we will accept 
there is a genuine vacancy for a migrant worker. 
 
4.5  When you apply for a licence under Tier 2 (ICT), you must send the supporting 
documents listed in Appendix A of the guidance for sponsors to confirm the 
link between you and the overseas entity. 
 
Tier 2 (Sportsperson) and Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) 
Creative and Sporting 
4.6 
To be allowed to apply for a licence to sponsor sportspeople, you must be a 
sporting body, sports club, events organiser or other organiser operating, or 
intending to work in, the sporting sector. You must be based in the UK – you 
cannot sponsor migrants under these provisions if you are an overseas-based 
sports club or organisation. You also cannot be a sponsor for sportspeople 
under these provisions if you are an agent. 
 
 
4.7  Before applying, you must make sure you have an endorsement from the 
Home Office approved governing body for your specific sport. The list of

"
28,Tier 2 (Sportsperson) and Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Creative and Sporting,
29,Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Charity Workers,"4.14  To apply for a licence as a sponsor of charity workers, you must be a 
registered, excepted or exempt UK charity in line with the relevant charity 
legislation in force in your part of the UK, or an ecclesiastical corporation, 
either corporation sole or body corporate, established for charitable purposes.

"
30,Tier 5 creative sector,"4.15  To be allowed to apply for a licence to sponsor creative workers and their 
entourage, you must be operating, or intending to operate, in the creative 
sector. Examples include, but are not limited to: 
 
•  a national body 
•  event organiser 
•  producer

Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Government Authorised 
Exchange  
4.16  This category is for migrants coming to the UK through approved schemes 
that aim to share knowledge, experience and best practice. The existing 
Government Authorised Exchange (GAE) schemes are listed at Appendix N to 
the Immigration Rules. The underlying principles of such schemes are that: 
 
 
•  the scheme must be endorsed by a government department 
•  the scheme will be administered by a single overarching sponsor 
4.17  We wish to avoid any unnecessary proliferation of GAE schemes. While it 
remains possible to add new GAE schemes to the existing list, we will 
consider doing so only where there is a compelling case for a new scheme. 
We reserve the right not to agree proposals for GAE schemes even where 
these have secured the support of another government department. In 
addition to requiring that the criteria set out below must be met, we will only 
agree proposals for a new GAE scheme, or to the renewal of existing 
schemes, where: 
•  (for new schemes) the proposed scheme meets a need that is not catered 
for by an existing scheme or any other provisions of the Immigration Rules 
•  the purpose of the proposed scheme does not conflict with wider 
considerations of immigration policy 
•  the purpose and foreseeable benefits of the scheme are clearly and 
directly linked to a specific wider Government policy objective, provide a 
unique opportunity for the sharing of knowledge or the delivery of 
workplace experience or training that cannot reasonably be accessed in a 
non-EEA national’s home country or usual country of residence, the 
delivery of which is best served by admitting non-EEA nationals to the UK 
•  we are satisfied that the government department endorsing the proposed 
scheme will put in place measures to monitor the operation of the scheme 
and assess delivery against the scheme’s objectives. This includes 
reporting to us on an annual basis on the benefits that the scheme is 
bringing, how it is meeting its objectives and the measures in place to 
guard against abuse   
If you wish to seek agreement to the introduction of a new GAE scheme, you 
will need to:  
Determine who the overarching body will be  
 
If you want to set up a scheme under the GAE subcategory of Tier 5 but 
cannot act as the overarching body (for example, if you want a sector wide 
scheme but you only represent a small part of your sector), you may need to 
identify an organisation that is suitable to act as the overarching body. This 
organisation will need to be in a position to comply with the sponsorship 
obligations set out in this guidance.

31,Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Government Authorised Exchange,
32,Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) International Agreement,"4.20  To be allowed to apply for a licence to sponsor under the Tier 5 (Temporary 
Worker) International Agreement category, you must intend to sponsor: 
 
 
•  employees of overseas governments 
•  employees of international organisations 
•  private servants in diplomatic households or households of officials 
working for international organisations 
You must be a diplomatic mission or international organisation recognised by 
the UK (an international organisation includes offices of ‘states’ not recognised 
Page 35 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
by the UK). The ’List of international organisations whose employees qualify 
for exempt entry clearances’ is available on GOV.UK. If you are applying as 
an international organisation, you must be named on this list. 
 
4.21  An application for a sponsor licence is deemed to include an 
acknowledgement that we may seek, from your Head of Mission or Head of 
Organisation, a limited waiver of inviolability and of immunity in order to enter 
your residence or premises to undertake compliance activity relating to your 
application or your sponsor licence. 
4.22  When making your application, you must send a signed letter from your Head 
of Mission, or Head of Organisation, confirming that they: 
•  agree to the application being made 
•  wish to sponsor migrants under Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) International 
Agreement 
•  accept the sponsorship requirements 
 
Sponsoring contractual service suppliers and independent 
professionals 
4.23 
If you have contracted with an overseas supplier for the delivery of services 
covered by one of the international trade agreements listed in Appendix F of 
the guidance for sponsors, and a contractual service supplier or independent 
professional needs to come to the UK to provide that service to you as the end 
user of that service, you must sponsor them under the International 
Agreement subcategory of Tier 5. 
 
4.24 
If your licence is approved, you can only assign a CoS to a contractual service 
supplier or independent professional who is coming to the UK to service that 
specific contract and no others.

Can a licence reflect the structure of my organisation? 
5. 
If you have a number of different offices, UK based subsidiaries or entities, 
locations or campuses, which we call ‘branches’ in this guidance, you can 
register in a number of ways, including by: 
•  applying for a single licence that includes your head office and all 
branches in the UK 
•  each branch applying for a separate licence 
•  grouping a number of branches in a single licence, such as a large UK 
wide company might find it more convenient to register all of its operations 
in a particular region under a single licence 
 
5.1  We may ask for evidence to show that your head office and/or group of 
branches listed, for any tier, are linked by common ownership or control. We 
assess common ownership or control of branches as we assess it for 
applications for a Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) licence. 
 
5.2  We will not allow you to add a branch to another sponsor licence you hold if: 
 
•  the branch’s sponsor licence is currently suspended whilst we investigate 
•  the branch has a B-rating 
•  the branch’s licence has been revoked within the past 12 months 
•  the branch is unable to offer a genuine vacancy that meets the suitability 
criteria of your licence 
If you have a number of branches that are individually licensed and we revoke 
the licence from one of those branches or downgrade it to a B-rating, we will 
not automatically remove or downgrade the licences from the other branches, 
but we will investigate them. 
If you are licensed as a ‘head office and all UK branches’ and we revoke your 
licence or downgrade it to a B-rating, this will apply to all your branches. If we 
revoke your licence, none of your branches will be able to sponsor migrants. If 
you are sponsoring migrants when your licence is revoked, we will limit the 
permission they have to be in the UK, because they will no longer be working 
for a licensed sponsor. The ‘What happens to my sponsored migrants if my 
licence is suspended’ section of this guidance has information on what 
happens to migrants if we are considering action against you, or if we revoke 
your licence. 
If any of your branches later apply for an individual licence, we will take into 
account any evidence of previous abuse or non-compliance, and the reasons 
for it, when considering the application.

Employment agencies, employment businesses and intra-
company transfers 
5.6 
If you are an employment agency, you can apply for a sponsor licence but only 
to sponsor migrant workers who will be directly employed by you in connection 
with the running of your business. You cannot sponsor a migrant if you will 
then supply them as labour, to another organisation, regardless of any 
genuine contractual arrangement between the parties involved. 
If you are an employment agency or intermediary and we grant a sponsor 
licence to you on this basis, but later find that the migrants you are sponsoring 
have been supplied as labour to another organisation, we will revoke your 
licence. 
If you are a sponsor that wants to employ a migrant worker who has been 
supplied to you by an employment agency or an intermediary, you can only 
assign a certificate of sponsorship to the migrant if you: 
•  have genuine responsibility for deciding all the duties, functions and 
outcomes, or outputs of the job the migrant is doing 
•  are responsible for agreeing and paying the migrant’s salary 
 
Franchises 
5.9

If you, either as an organisation, a sole trader or partnership have a number of 
franchises under your control, you can decide whether to apply for a licence as 
a ‘head office and all UK branches’ or have each franchise licensed 
individually. 
If your franchises are separate businesses, not under your control (as the 
parent organisation), you must have a separate licence for each one.

6  Key personnel and others involved 
with your organisation 
The online sponsor application requires you to give certain responsibilities to 
members of your staff, some or all of whom will have access to the 
sponsorship management system (SMS) after a licence is granted. We call 
these people ‘key personnel’ and there are 4 roles, which are: 
 
 
 
 
Key personnel 
6. 
•  authorising officer 
•  key contact 
•  level 1 user 
•  level 2 user 
 
6.1  Only level 1 and 2 users will have access to the SMS. If the authorising officer 
or key contact requires access, they must also be set up as a level 1 or level 2 
user. 
 
6.2  Each of your key personnel must: 
 
•  be permanently based in the UK for the duration of the period that they fill 
the role you have appointed them to 
•  meet the requirements on criminal convictions set out in Annex 1 of this 
•  be a paid member of your staff or engaged by you as an office holder - the 
guidance 
only exceptions are: 
o  a level 1 or level 2 user can be an employee of a third-party 
organisation to whom you have contracted some or all of your human 
resources function to; however, you must have at least one level 1 
user who is an employee, partner or director in your company – we 
will reject applications where you do not have a level 1 user who is an 
employee, partner or director in your company 
o  a level 2 user can be a member of staff supplied to you, but employed 
by an employment agency 
o  an overarching sponsor licensed under Tier 5 (Government 
Authorised Exchange) can appoint level 2 users within the 
organisations taking part in the exchange programme, more 
information is available in the ‘Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Government 
Authorised Exchange’ section 
o  an insolvency professional who has been appointed because you 
have gone into administration can fill any key personnel role 
o  a UK based representative can fill any key personnel role except the 
role of authorising officer - if you already have a sponsor licence but 
you now want a representative to help assign certificates of 
sponsorship (CoS), you must add the relevant employees of the 
representative to the SMS as level 1 or level 2 users

6.3  None of your ‘key personnel’ can be: 
 
•  a representative who is not based in the UK 
•  a contractor or consultant who is contracted for a specific project 
•  subject to a Bankruptcy Restriction Order, or Undertaking 
•  subject to a Debt Relief Restriction Order, or Undertaking 
•  legally prohibited from being a company director 
 
We may refuse your application where you have previously been named as 
key personnel at any sponsor organisation where an application for a licence 
was refused within the last 6 months or where a licence has been revoked 
within the last 12 months. More information is given in Annex 2 and 6 of this 
guidance. We also reserve the right to undertake checks on persons 
associated with sponsors who do not fall under the general definition of ‘you’ 
or ‘your’. Such persons may include, for example, employees in positions of 
responsibility who are not directors or key personnel and financiers involved in 
the running of your institution. Where appropriate, we may refuse your 
application or take action against your licence. 
If you are or have been an owner, director or authorising officer of a sponsor 
institution that has been ordered to pay costs to the Home Office in any legal 
proceedings, and those costs have not been paid, we will also refuse your 
application or take appropriate action against your licence on the basis of 
litigation debt.  
 
6.4  Where we use the term ‘office holder’ this has a specific meaning. If an 
individual holds an office under one of the following types of appointment, it is 
likely that they are an ‘office holder’: 
•  a statutory appointment – this could be registered company directors or 
secretaries, board members of statutory bodies, judges or tribunal 
members, or crown appointments, such as, the police 
•  an appointment under the internal constitution of an organisation – this 
could be club treasurers or trade union secretaries 
•  an appointment under a trust deed – this could be trustees 
•  an ecclesiastical – this could be members of the clergy 
If an individual is an office holder, they are neither an employee nor a worker. 
You should note holding an office does not prevent an individual from 
becoming a worker or an employee. An individual can be an office holder and 
an employee if their working arrangements take the form of a contractual 
relationship and satisfy the test for employee status. The ‘Employment status’ 
page on GOV.UK has more information to help you decide whether a person 
is an office holder.  
 
6.5 
 
6.6  You must name your authorising officer, key contact and level 1 user on the 
application form. These roles can be filled by the same person or a 
combination of different people. There can only be one authorising officer and 
one key contact, but you can appoint more level 1 users once you have been 
Page 40 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
granted a licence. Level 2 users can only be appointed by a level 1 user so 
you can only add a level 2 user after your licence has been granted. 
 
 
 
 
6.7  You must give contact details for your key personnel both when applying for a 
licence and when changing any key personnel or adding new ones after we 
have granted a licence. The contact address given for each of your key 
personnel must be either your main address or that of any branch or head 
office you are including in, or have subsequently added to, your licence. All 
email addresses you provide for all of your key personnel must be secure, 
personal to and only accessible by the named individual. You must also 
provide their National Insurance number if they have one. 
6.8  Where you are appointing a level 2 user who is an employee of a third-party 
organisation engaged by you to deliver all or part of your human resources 
function, the address provided must be the core business address of the third-
party organisation. 
6.9  Where you are appointing a representative to the key contact role, the address 
must be the representative’s main business address. 
6.10  You are responsible for anything done by anyone you have set up as a user of 
the SMS, including representatives. If we are considering taking action against 
you, we will treat anything done by a representative on your behalf as if it was 
done by you. You may want to take precautions, by checking the identity of the 
representative and ensuring that they are suitable to do the activity required. If 
you do not meet your responsibilities, we will take action against you. 
 
6.11  We may make checks on you and we will always check authorising officers, 
key contacts and level 1 users. These include checks against our records and 
the police national computer, or its equivalent in Northern Ireland. We will 
make these checks when considering your application and may repeat them at 
any time during the life of your licence. We may also carry out checks if new 
individuals take up roles. If any of these people have an unspent criminal 
conviction for a relevant offence, regardless of whether you have declared 
them or not, or have been issued with a civil penalty by us, we will: 
•  refuse your application for a sponsor licence – see Annex 1 of this 
guidance for more information on the circumstances in which we will 
refuse your licence 
•  if you have already been granted a licence, refuse to accept a person you 
later nominate for a key personnel role 
•  revoke your licence - Annexes 5 and 6 of this guidance tells you the 
circumstances in which we will or may revoke your sponsor licence 
 
Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, criminal convictions may 
become ‘spent’ after specified periods of time from the date of conviction if 
there are no further convictions during that time. Spent convictions do not 
need to be declared to us. 
Page 41 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
We do not routinely undertake checks on persons associated with sponsors 
who do not fall under the general definition of ‘you’ or ‘your’. This could be 
employees in positions of responsibility who are not directors or key personnel 
and individual financiers involved in the running of your institution. We do 
reserve the right to undertake checks and may ask you for information on such 
individuals as part of the application process. The conduct of such persons, 
where relevant, may also be taken into account in deciding what action to 
take. Having taken these factors into account, we may either refuse your 
licence application or grant you a licence with limitations. Such limitations may 
include restricting your CoS allocation or asking you to nominate alternative 
key personnel where appropriate.  
 
6.12  SMS users must not assign a CoS to themselves or assign a CoS to a close 
relative or partner. A close relative or partner is: 
•  a spouse or civil partner  
•  an unmarried or a same-sex partner 
•  a parent or step-parent 
•  a son or step-son 
•  a daughter or step-daughter 
•  a brother, step-brother or half-brother 
•  a sister, step-sister or half-sister 
•  an aunt or uncle 
•  a nephew, niece or cousin 
•  a father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law or 
daughter-in-law 
 
6.13  You must have a minimum of one SMS user who is a settled worker. The only 
exceptions to this rule are the following: 
•  if you are a diplomatic mission or international organisation licensed under 
Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) International Agreement 
•  if your authorising officer is a person with valid leave as: 
o  a Representative of an Overseas Business 
o  a Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur) migrant 
o  a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) migrant 
o  a Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) migrant 
o  a Start-up migrant 
o  an Innovator 
o  a Global Talent migrant 
 
"
41,Authorising officer,"6.14  When applying for a licence, you must appoint an authorising officer. The 
person you nominate to this role must be your most senior person responsible 
for the recruitment of all migrant workers and ensuring that all of your sponsor 
duties are met. If you do not recruit the migrants you sponsor, this role must 
be filled by the most senior person responsible for your activity as a licensed 
sponsor. If there is more than one person who could fill this role, you must 
decide who to nominate. You are responsible for the actions of your

authorising officer, so we advise that you ensure you are confident that they 
fully understand the importance of this role. 
6.15  The authorising officer is also responsible for deciding how many of your staff 
needs to have access to the SMS and what level of permission they can have. 
They are responsible for the activities of all SMS users and must comply with 
our requirements for using the system. If they fail to do this, we will take action 
against you. 
6.16  The authorising officer does not have automatic access to the SMS. If they 
require access to the system, they will need to be set up as a level 1 or level 2 
user. This can be done by naming them as the level 1 user on your 
application, or adding them as an additional level 1 user or as a level 2 user 
after your licence has been granted. The authorising officer is responsible for 
the activities of all SMS users, so must have a system in place to check these 
activities. We recommend that, as a minimum, the authorising officer checks 
the CoS assigned to migrants on a monthly basis. 
 
6.17  You must have an authorising officer in place throughout the life of your 
licence. The nominated person must always meet the requirements set out in 
this guidance. If you fail to have an authorising officer in place who meets our 
requirements, or fail to tell us of a change in authorising officer, we will take 
action against you. 
 
"
42,Key contact,"6.18  The key contact is usually the person who acts as the main contact between 
us and you. We will contact them if we have any queries about your sponsor 
licence application, the documents sent or the payment. We may also contact 
your authorising officer if necessary. 
6.19  The key contact does not have automatic access to the SMS. If they require 
access to the system, they will need to be set up as a level 1 or level 2 user. 
This can be done by naming them as the level 1 user on your application, or 
adding them as an additional level 1 user or as a level 2 user after your licence 
has been granted.

43,Level 1 user,"6.20  The level 1 user can be the authorising officer or another person in your 
organisation. 
the SMS. 
 
6.21  The level 1 user must carry out your day-to-day sponsorship activities using 
 
6.22  When you first apply for a sponsor licence, you can only nominate one level 1 
user and they must be an employee, director or partner. Once you have a 
licence you can use the SMS to nominate more level 1 users. We will perform 
checks on new level 1 users before we give them access to the SMS. These 
include checks against our records and the police national computer, or its 
equivalent in Northern Ireland. 
 
Page 43 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
6.23  You can decide how many level 1 users you need. The authorising officer is 
responsible for their conduct, so we recommend that you do not have more 
level 1 users than you really need. You should make sure that you have at 
least enough to be able to cover periods of leave or sickness. 
 
6.24  The level 1 user must be one of the following: 
 
•  a paid staff member or office holder within your organisation  
•  an employee of a third-party organisation engaged by you to deliver all or 
part of your HR function  
•  a UK-based representative 
 
They must not be: 
•  a contractor 
•  a consultant who is contracted for a specific project 
•  a temporary staff member supplied to you by an employment agency  
•  an undischarged bankrupt 
 
6.25  You must always have a minimum of one level 1 user who is a settled worker. 
The only exceptions to this rule are: 
 
•  if you are a diplomatic mission or international organisation licensed under 
the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) International Agreement subcategory 
•  if your authorising officer is a person with valid leave as: 
o  a Representative of an Overseas Business 
o  a Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur) migrant 
o  a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) migrant 
o  a Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) migrant 
o  a Start-up migrant 
o  an Innovator 
o  a Global Talent migrant 
 
 
6.26  You must have at least one level 1 user in place. This is because it is 
impossible for you to meet all of your sponsor duties without one. If we find 
you do not have any level 1 users in place, we will take action against you. 
From 6 November 2014, new sponsors must have at least one level 1 user 
who is an employee. This is also best practice for existing sponsors. You can 
have more than one level 1 user, but at least one must be your employee. 
 
6.27  Level 1 users can perform the following actions in SMS:  
•  ask for more Level 1 users and add Level 2 users to the SMS or remove 
them  
•  assign CoS to workers 
•  ask for an increase in the number of CoS you can assign (your limit) 
•  tell us about minor changes to your details 
•  tell us of change of circumstances on the SMS 
Page 44 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
•  report worker activity to us, for example, inform us if a worker goes 
missing or does not come to work 
•  withdraw CoS 
•  tell us of changes to work addresses 
•  use the bulk data transfer feature 
•  change user details 
•  view information about your licence and key personnel 
•  access key messages that we post from time to time 
•  apply to renew your licence and track the progress of your application 
•  apply for premium customer service and track the progress of your 
application 
•  apply for Tier 2 and/or Tier 5 premium sponsor status and track the 
progress of your application 
 
"
44,Level 2 user,"6.28  Level 2 users have fewer permissions than level 1 users. Level 2 users can 
perform the following actions in SMS: 
 
•  assign CoS to workers 
•  report worker activity to us, for example, inform us if a worker goes 
missing or does not come to work 
 
6.29  You can decide how many level 2 users you need. The authorising officer is 
responsible for them, so we recommend that you do not have more level 2 
users than you really need. 
 
6.30  Level 2 user may be: 
 
•  a paid staff member or office holder within your organisation 
•  an employee of a third-party organisation engaged by you to deliver all or 
part of your HR function 
•  a temporary staff member supplied to you by an employment agency  
•  a UK-based representative 
They must not be: 
•  a contractor

7  Criteria 
 
Eligibility criteria 
7.1 
All applications for a sponsor licence must meet the following eligibility and 
suitability criteria. 
To confirm that you are eligible for a licence, you must provide the supporting 
documents listed in Appendix A of the guidance for sponsors and any more 
documents we request. 
 
7.2  We verify these documents to make sure you are genuine and have an 
operating or trading presence in the UK. If you have no operating or trading 
presence in the UK, we will refuse your application. If we find that you have no 
operating or trading presence in the UK after granting a licence, we will revoke 
it. 
 
Suitability criteria 
7.3 
The suitability criteria determine whether we grant or refuse your application, 
change the rating of an existing licence or revoke an existing licence. It may 
also affect the limits and review points we set for certificates of sponsorship 
(CoS) that you can assign. 
 
7.4 
To assess suitability criteria, we look at whether: 
 
•  you have human resource and recruitment systems in place to meet, or 
continue to meet your sponsor duties - we may judge this by visiting you 
either before or after your licence is granted 
•  we are able to visit and conduct checks to ensure that the sponsor duties 
are being complied with on an immediate, unannounced basis; this 
includes checks at any physical addresses where your sponsored 
employees (would) carry out their employment duties - if access to a third 
party’s site is deemed necessary by us (either at application stage or later 
as part of compliance checks), we would need to see evidence of 
arrangements between you and the third party that would ensure full 
cooperation by the third party 
•  you can offer a genuine vacancy which meets the criteria of the category 
you are applying to be licensed for; this may mean that if your business 
involves operating no (or little) physical office space (a ‘virtual business 
model’), we will consider the type of work a sponsored worker will be 
doing and where the worker will be carrying out their employment duties - 
we may wish to see contracts between you and any third party   
•  you have an unspent criminal conviction for a relevant offence - Annex 1 
and Annex 5 of this guidance have more information on this 
•  we have any evidence of previous non-compliance by you  
 
7.5  You must tell us on the covering letter accompanying your submission sheet if 
any of the following apply to you, under the general definition of ‘you’ or ‘your’, 
if you:

•  have any criminal prosecutions pending 
•  are aware that an organisation that you have been involved with in a 
similar role has failed to pay VAT or any other form of excise duty 
If you have a criminal prosecution pending, we will put your application on hold 
pending the outcome unless we have other reasons to refuse it, in which case, 
we will refuse it without waiting. 
"
48,Checks we make,"7.6  We use risk assessments to guide our compliance activity and focus that 
activity on the areas of highest risk. If we know little about you or are 
concerned with the evidence provided, we will make further checks including 
an on-site visit. We may also make relevant checks with other government 
departments. 
 
If you operate a virtual business model, it is highly likely that we will conduct 
an on-site visit to your authorising officer’s physical address before making a 
decision on your application for a licence. If we have significant doubts about 
your ability to fulfil your sponsorship duties after a visit, we may refuse your 
application. The ‘Compliance’ section has more information about compliance 
visits, including on-site visits. 
 
7.8  We may also conduct an on-site visit to any other physical addresses where 
your sponsored migrants would be carrying out their employment duties.  
7.9 
If there are differences between what you told us and what our compliance 
officer finds during a check and this is found before a decision has been made, 
we will let you know whether we need more information before making a final 
decision.  
7.10  We ask for a variety of verifiable documents to allow us to consider your 
application. These are all listed in Appendix A of the guidance for sponsors 
and we may check any or all of the documents you send to us. We reserve the 
right to ask for more documents at any time during the licence application 
process or the validity period of your licence and sometimes we may ask for 
other documents which are not listed in Appendix A. 
7.11  We make further checks in the following circumstances: 
 
•  quality assurance checks - we check a certain percentage of applications 
•  extra checks - if we have reasonable doubts about your application or the 
documents sent with your application

8  Supporting evidence – documents 
Appendix A of the guidance for sponsors lists the evidence we will need from 
you to support your licence application. Most applications must be supported 
by a minimum of 4 pieces of evidence. Some of this evidence will be in the 
form of a document you must send to us and some will simply be an online 
check that we can do, without you having to send a document to us. Certain 
evidence is mandatory, in most cases we will only need a maximum of 4 
pieces of evidence, but we may ask for more if necessary. If you fail to send 
us any evidence or documents we ask for within the given time limit, your 
application will be refused. 
 
8.1  Over time, we will start to make more checks online and we are gradually 
updating Appendix A to show where we will make an online check instead of 
asking you to send us a document. Where we can conduct an online check, 
this will count as one piece of evidence. 
Example 
You are a charity, registered with the Charities Commission, applying for Tier 
2 (Sportsperson). In this example, you must send us 3 documents and we will 
conduct one online check. Grand total - 4 pieces of evidence. 
1.  Appendix A: Table 2 - we must have evidence of your charitable status, but 
we can check this online. This counts as one piece of evidence. 
 
2.  Appendix A: Table 3 - we must have evidence of your endorsement from 
the governing body for your sport. You must send us the relevant 
document. This counts as one piece of evidence. 
 
3.  Appendix A: Table 4 - you must choose 2 more pieces of evidence from 
Table 4 to bring your total to 4. 
 
If you are applying as a head office and all branches or a group of branches 
and you are required to be registered with and/or inspected/monitored by a 
regulatory body, you must send evidence for each individual branch within that 
group. 
 
Example 
You are a care home in England applying for Tier 2 (General) with 3 additional 
branches included in your application. In this example, there are 7 mandatory 
pieces of evidence - one online check on your Care Quality Commission 
(CQC) status, 3 documents from Table 4 and 3 additional online checks on the 
CQC status of the branches named on your application. 
1.  Appendix A, Table 2 - we must have evidence that you are inspected by 
the CQC. We will check this online, for each care home included in your 
application. This means we will do 4 online checks.

8.5  Any documents or other evidence that we ask to see that are not in English or 
Welsh must be accompanied by a certified translation. The translator’s 
credentials should be provided, along with their official confirmation that the 
translation is accurate. 
If you provide certified copies of documents and/or certified translations, we 
reserve the right to ask for the original documents. 
 
8.6  We make further checks if we have any doubts about whether you can meet 
the requirements of the category in which you have applied. We may email 
you to ask for more evidence or information. We always email the person you 
named as your key contact, but we may also email your authorising officer. 
 
8.7  Any documents you send to us will be returned by recorded delivery to the 
address given on your application. If you want the documents returned by 
special delivery, you must enclose a prepaid special delivery envelope. 
 
"
51,Standard procedure for verifying documents,"8.8  We may check details or the correctness or genuineness of documents: 
 
•  with the issuing organisation, like banks, universities and professional 
bodies 
•  with other government departments in the UK and overseas 
The procedure for verifying documents is:  
 
•  we use a standard format to record the results of enquiries to make sure 
we record feedback consistently 
•  if we cannot get an immediate answer to our enquiries, we will normally 
wait for a maximum of 3 weeks for the information 
•  we may decide that a compliance officer needs to visit you 
 
"
52,Outcome of document checks,"8.9 
 
There are 3 possible outcomes after a document check: 
•  document confirmed genuine - if we conclude the document is genuine, 
we will consider your application as normal 
•  document confirmed as false - if we conclude the document is false, we 
will refuse your application, whether or not the document is essential to 
your application 
•  check inconclusive - if we are unable to verify whether or not a document 
is genuine or false we will not use the document as evidence to support 
your application, we may ask for further supporting documents

9  Rating sponsors 
A sponsor licence can be rated either ‘A’ or ‘B’. 
 
What are sponsor ratings? 
9. 
 
9.1  An A-rating is awarded when you are first granted a licence on the basis that 
you have systems in place to be able to meet your sponsor duties. Your 
licence rating appears on the published register of licensed sponsors. We will 
not grant a licence if you are not able to achieve an A-rating. 
 
9.2  After your licence has been granted, if we find evidence that you are unable or 
unwilling to continue to meet your sponsor duties, or we have evidence of 
immigration abuse, we may take action against you.  
 
9.3  Your rating will usually be the same for all the tiers, categories and 
subcategories in which you are registered. In exceptional cases, if we later find 
that you are not meeting your sponsor duties in only one tier on your licence, 
we will downgrade that tier to a B-rating. The ‘Downgrading your licence rating’ 
section has more information. 
 
Scoring system 
9.4  When deciding the suitability of an application or when we carry out checks 
(including if we visit you) after your licence has been granted, we will use the 
following scoring system when deciding whether to grant your application for a 
licence. 
 
9.5  We give a score of ‘met’ or ‘not met’ for the following: 
 
•  human resource systems - whether you have systems in place that 
allow you to know when a migrant has not turned up for work, or to identify 
when their current leave is coming to an end 
•  convictions and civil penalties - whether or not you have an unspent 
criminal conviction for a relevant offence or have become liable for a civil 
penalty, including those issued to landlords under the ‘Right to rent 
scheme’; Annex 1 of this guidance has more information on this 
•  migrant compliance - whether you are employing any migrants, 
sponsored or not, who are in breach of the conditions of their leave - for 
example, a migrant with leave as a Tier 4 student working more hours 
than they are allowed to 
•  employment - in respect of Tier 2 (General) licences, we will assess 
whether you can offer genuine employment which meets the Tier 2 
(General) criteria on skill level and appropriate rates of pay 
 
Below are 2 examples of circumstances in which we may not be satisfied you 
can offer genuine Tier 2 (General) employment.

Example 1 
You do not currently employ, or have never employed, anyone in a role which 
meets the current Tier 2 requirements. This could be if you are a small retail 
outlet and currently only have people working for you as shop assistants or in 
other low skilled roles. 
Example 2 
You tell us you require or have already sponsored a person in a managerial 
role which appears unnecessary. This could be if you are a small fast food 
outlet and you tell us you need, or have appointed, a full-time business 
development manager, HR manager or publicity manager. 
Note: these examples are not exhaustive. 
If you are chosen for a visit, we will score your suitability to be a licensed 
sponsor as shown below: 
 
•  meets all of the criteria 
•  does not meet one or more of the criteria 
9.7  We will grant your licence if you meet all of the criteria and there are no other 
reasons for refusing your application. 
9.8  We will refuse your application if you do not meet one or more of the criteria. 
 
9.9 
If we visit you after we have granted you a licence, we assess you again 
against the suitability criteria as well as making any other checks we need to 
carry out. If we find that you have not met any or all of your sponsor duties, we 
will take action against you.

10 Notification of decision 
 
What happens after a decision on my application has been 
made? 
10.  We will write to you to tell you: 
 
•  whether we have approved or refused your application 
•  the reasons for the decision if we have refused your application 
•  if we have approved your application, the maximum number of certificates 
of sponsorship (CoS) you will be allowed to assign, or that we have set 
your allocation of CoS to zero if you are unsure whether or when you may 
need to recruit any migrants in the future 
 
10.1  We send decision letters and return all original documents to the address 
given for the authorising officer on your online sponsor application. We send 
all documents by Royal Mail Signed For delivery. 
 
If my application is refused, can I apply again? 
10.2  There is no right of appeal against the refusal of a licence application. 
However, if you believe that the refusal decision is either: 
•  the result of a caseworker error – for example, if we have incorrectly 
applied the 6-month cooling-off period and you send evidence to us to 
support this  
•  the result of supporting evidence sent as part of your application not being 
considered by us – for example, if we have not considered a specific piece 
of information and you send evidence to show this was received by us 
you can send an ‘Error correction request form’. This form is on the ‘UK visa 
sponsorship for employers’ page on GOV.UK. 
The request must be sent within 14 calendar days from the date of the refusal 
decision letter. We aim to get back to you within 28 working days of the receipt 
of your error correction request form. 
The pre-licence error correction process does not offer a full reconsideration 
of a decision to refuse a licence application. We will not consider any 
additional evidence which was not available at the time of application. 
 
If we establish that a simple caseworker error has occurred, or a piece of 
information sent at the time of application has not been considered, we will 
write to you inviting you to send a new online sponsor licence application with 
the appropriate fee. On receipt of the application, your fee will be refunded. 
Sending a new application is not a guarantee that a licence will be granted. 
If we maintain our original decision to refuse your licence application, we will 
write to tell you. The 6-month sponsor cooling-off period will continue to apply 
from the date of the original refusal decision. A refusal decision will not be

59,Cooling-off period following decision to refuse a licence,"10.4 
If you have been refused a licence, you should not make another application 
until 6 months after the date of the Home Office decision letter refusing your 
application. 
Similarly, if you withdrew a previous application while we were undertaking 
checks on you which revealed something that was likely to lead to a refusal of 
that application, you should not make another application until 6 months after 
the date of the Home Office letter accepting the withdrawal of your application.  
If you reapply before 6 months has passed from the date of the previous 
refusal or withdrawal, we will refuse your application if the previous refusal (or 
likely refusal had you not withdrawn your application) was because you: 
•  did not meet the requirements to be a sponsor in the category under which 
 
you applied 
•  sent false documents 
•  did not have the processes necessary to comply with your sponsor duties 
•  have, or had, an unspent criminal conviction for a relevant offence – see 
the Glossary and Annex 1 for a definition of ‘relevant offence’ 
•  are legally prohibited from becoming a company director, unless this is 
due to being an undischarged bankrupt – you should note that the 
authorising officer or level 1 user must not be an undischarged bankrupt 
•  had no trading presence in the UK 
If you have been refused because you have previously been issued with a civil 
penalty under section 15 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, 
Accession of Croatia (Immigration and Worker Authorisation) Regulations 
2013 or section 23 of the Immigration Act 2014, you should only reapply 12 
months after the date the penalty became payable. Annex 1 of this guidance 
has more information on this. 
If you have been refused because you have previously been issued with a civil 
penalty for one of the ‘charges or penalties’ in Appendix C of the guidance for 
sponsors, apart from employing an illegal worker or authorising occupation of 
premises under a residential tenancy agreement by an adult who is 
disqualified because of their immigration status, you should only reapply when 
5 years have passed since the date the penalty was issued. 
If you have been refused because you previously held a sponsor licence, in 
any tier, and we revoked your licence or, after we had notified you that we are 
taking compliance action against you, you surrendered your licence, you must 
not reapply until 12 months have passed since the date we notified you of the 
revocation or approval of your licence surrender.

either:  
•  it was sent by a representative 
•  you did not provide documents or information we requested by a specific 
deadline for reasons outside your control 
 
10.9  When you reapply, you must ensure that the reasons we refused you no 
longer apply. As part of the application process, you may receive a visit from a 
UKVI compliance officer, who will undertake relevant checks to establish that 
you have the necessary systems and procedures in place to meet your 
sponsorship obligations. If we are not satisfied that you can fully meet your

11 Sponsorship management system 
 
What is the sponsorship management system? 
11.  Once licensed, you will be given access to use the sponsorship management 
system (SMS). This online function lets you carry out day to day activities and 
report any changes to us, such as a change of address. You will also use it to 
assign certificates of sponsorship (CoS) to migrants who wish to come to, or 
stay in, the UK to work, and to fulfil your reporting duties for your sponsored 
migrants. The ‘Reporting duties’ and ‘Certificates of sponsorship’ sections 
have more information. 
 
11.1  We call a person who has access to the SMS a ‘user’. The SMS allows users 
2 levels of access – ‘level 1’ and ‘level 2’. The level decides the type of access 
(permissions) the user has to the system and the functions they can perform, 
the ‘Level 1 user’ and ‘Level 2 user’ sections have more information. 
 
11.2  Your SMS account is also a source of information about your sponsor licence. 
You can see details on how many SMS users you have appointed and who 
they are, the date your licence will expire, the number of CoS left to assign, 
and when your allocation of CoS will expire. Your SMS account also has a 
‘message board’ where we post useful messages. 
 
11.3  You need to regularly access your SMS account to review and update your 
licence details and to keep up to date with the latest news, messages and any 
changes that may be coming up. We recommend that your level 1 user 
accesses your account at least once a month. 
 
11.4  When we grant your sponsor licence, we set up your SMS account and send 
the level 1 user’s ‘user name’ to your authorising officer by post. We send the 
level 1 user their password by email. Once your level 1 user has successfully 
accessed your SMS account, they can perform a number of functions. The 
‘Level 1 user’ section has more information on this. 
 
11.5  SMS users must never give their password to anyone else. If they do, we may 
revoke your licence. 
You can use the SMS on GOV.UK to: 
•  manage or renew your organisation’s licence or services 
•  create and assign certificates of sponsorship to prospective employees for 
Tiers 2 and/or 5  
•  report changes of circumstances of your sponsored employees or 
students, including withdrawal of sponsorship 
 
You can also find some helpful guides under ‘User manuals: sponsorship 
management system (SMS)’ on the ‘Sponsorship: guidance for employers and 
educators’ page on GOV.UK.

•  manage or renew your organisation’s licence or services 
•  create and assign certificates of sponsorship to prospective employees for 
Tiers 2 and/or 5  
•  report changes of circumstances of your sponsored employees or 
students, including withdrawal of sponsorship 
 
You can also find some helpful guides under ‘User manuals: sponsorship 
management system (SMS)’ on the ‘Sponsorship: guidance for employers and

11.6  You are responsible for your actions and the actions of a representative or 
employee who assigns CoS on your behalf. Any non-compliance with the rules 
on assigning CoS will result in us taking action against you. If we find you are 
employing an illegal migrant worker because your recruitment practices are 
negligent, we may issue you with a civil penalty and refer your case for 
prosecution. 
You must have at least one level 1 user who must be your employee in place 
throughout the life of your licence. If we find you have no level 1 user in place 
at all, this means you cannot fulfil your sponsor duties and we will take action 
against you. We will also take action against you if you have no SMS users in 
place at all. 
 
"
66,Adding tiers,"11.7  Once your licence has been granted, you can add more tiers, categories and 
subcategories to it. To do this, your level 1 user must log in to the online 
sponsor licence application form using your original log in details or by 
registering again. They will then fill in a shortened version of the online 
application which allows them to apply to add new tiers or categories to your 
licence. They will not be able to change anything else. You must also pay any 
extra fee and send us any more mandatory documents that may be needed. 
The authorising officer must approve this action, and the level 1 user must 
retain the evidence of the approval. 
 
11.8  You will not be allowed to add tiers if your licence is suspended or 
downgraded to a B-rating. 
 
11.9 
If you want to apply to add an extra tier or category to your licence, but you 
want different people to act as authorising officer and key contact for the new 
tier or category, you must apply for a separate, new licence and pay the fee 
where applicable. This is because there can only be one authorising officer 
and key contact named on a sponsor licence.

12 What happens if my circumstances 
change? 
 
12.  You must tell us of any changes to your details. We may ask for more details 
and documents to support the change you are requesting. 
 
12.1  Your level 1 user must use your SMS account ‘request changes to sponsor 
details’ function to: 
•  change your address 
•  change your name 
•  change the details of, or replace, your authorising officer or key contact 
•  tell us about changes to your structure, such as more branches or sites, or 
new linked entities in the UK or overseas if you are licensed under Tier 2 
(ICT) 
•  tell us if you are convicted of a relevant offence - Annex 1 and Annex 5 of 
this guidance have more information on relevant offences 
•  tell us about a change in the status of any registration by a governing body 
•  amend your organisation details, such as telling us of takeovers and 
that you need to hold 
mergers 
•  tell us that you have sold all or part of your business 
•  tell us of any other changes to your circumstances, such as adding or 
removing a representative or surrendering your licence 
 
The following changes you report may automatically update your SMS 
account: 
•  your main, or head office address 
•  the address of your authorising officer, key contact, or level 1 user - if their 
new address matches your main or head office address, or the address of 
your representative for a key contact or level 1 user 
 
We will write to you if we are able to make these or any other changes 
automatically. 
 
12.2 
If you request a change to the name on your licence, we will need to 
understand why you are changing your name because, in some 
circumstances, you may have to apply for a new licence. For example, if the 
only reason you are changing your name is because you are incorporating 
yourself for the first time, and nothing else is changing, we can change the 
name on your licence. If your change of name is part of a wider change – for 
example, if you are involved in a merger or takeover – you may have to apply 
for a new sponsor licence. The ‘Mergers and takeovers’ section explains this 
in more detail.

68,What happens if I become insolvent?,"12.8 
If you go into administration, including special administration, or administrative 
receivership (receivership in Scotland), you must tell the administrator or 
receiver that you are a licensed sponsor and tell us within 20 working days of 
going into administration or receivership. 
12.9  The insolvency professional appointed as the administrator or receiver must 
be appointed as your authorising officer (AO). This can be done in 2 ways: 
 
•  if they are content for your named level 1 user to stay in that role, then the 
level 1 user can use the ‘request changes to sponsor details’ function 
within your SMS account to replace your AO 
•  if they do not want your level 1 user to continue to access your SMS 
account, they must fill in a change of circumstances form to appoint 
themselves as your new level 1 user - see the ‘What happens if my 
circumstances change’ section; they must write ‘In Administration’ across 
the top of the change of circumstances form so we can make sure that it is 
dealt with quickly -  once we have approved that change, they can then 
appoint themselves as the new authorising officer using your SMS 
account 
 
12.10  If the administrator or receiver does not want any of your SMS users to 
continue accessing your SMS account, they must fill in a change of 
circumstances form to appoint themselves as a new level 1 user. They must 
decide whether your SMS users should be replaced, or whether they are 
content for them to keep their level 1 or level 2 SMS access. 
 
12.11  There are different ways in which you can come out of administration, 
including special administration or administrative receivership (receivership in 
Scotland) and some will have an impact on your continuing permission to hold 
a sponsor licence. The deciding reason will be whether or not you continue to 
own your business. 
 
Company voluntary arrangement or debt arrangement 
scheme  
12.12  If you enter into a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), you must tell us 
within 20 working days of this being agreed and also tell us if it has resulted in 
a change of ownership. Where there is a change of ownership, we will treat 
this as if you had sold your business and will revoke your sponsor licence. If 
you are sponsoring any migrants when ownership changes and the new owner 
wants to continue employing them, they must apply for a sponsor licence 
within 20 working days of taking ownership. The ‘Mergers, takeovers and 
similar changes’ section has more information on this. 
 
12.13  If the CVA amounts to an agreement with your creditors, but no change in 
ownership, then you can continue to hold your sponsor licence. You can also 
remove the administrator from the position of authorising officer and appoint 
either your original authorising officer or a new one. You must do this using 
your SMS account.

"
69,Company voluntary arrangement or debt arrangement scheme,
70,Liquidation or sequestration,"12.15  If you go into voluntary or compulsory liquidation, you must tell us within 20 
working days of ceasing trading. If sequestration has been awarded or you 
have signed a Trust Deed and either of these means you stop trading, you 
must tell us within 20 working days of the date you finish trading. If you or any 
appointed insolvency professional cannot access your sponsorship 
management system (SMS) account to report this, you must email the 
Sponsor Compliance team. We will then revoke your sponsor licence. 
 
"
71,Sole traders,"12.16  If you are a sole trader and you enter into an individual voluntary arrangement 
(IVA) or a debt arrangement scheme (DAS), you must tell us using your 
sponsor management system (SMS) account within 20 working days. If your 
IVA or DAS amounts to an agreement with your creditors where you remain 
sole owner of your business and continue to trade, you must also tell us about 
this. If this happens, you can keep your sponsor licence. 
 
12.17  If your IVA or DAS results in your business being sold, you must tell us within 
20 working days. We will then revoke your sponsor licence. If you are 
sponsoring any migrants when your business is sold, and the new owner 
wishes to continue employing them, they must apply for a sponsor licence 
within 20 working days of taking ownership. The ‘Mergers, takeovers and 
similar changes’ section has more information on change of ownership. 
 
If you are a sole trader and a court issues a bankruptcy order against you, or 
sequestration has been awarded, you must tell us this within 20 working days. 
You will not be able to do this using your SMS account because you will not be 
permitted to access it. You must email the Sponsor Compliance team telling 
us the date you finished trading. We will then revoke your sponsor licence.

13 Mergers, takeovers and similar 
changes 
 
What happens if I am involved in a merger, takeover or de-
merger? 
13. 
 
This section explains what you must do if you are involved in: 
•  a change of ownership 
•  a merger 
•  a takeover 
•  a de-merger  
Examples include where you sell all or part of your business, or the controlling 
number of shares in your business. 
It also explains what you must do if you lose or accept sponsored migrants 
whose employment is being transferred under the Transfer of Undertakings 
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) arrangements or similar 
protection. You can find more information about TUPE and similar protection 
on the GOV.UK website. 
Your sponsor licence is not transferrable and what happens depends on 
whether: 
 
organisation 
•  there is a change in direct ownership  
•  you sell all or part of, or the controlling number of shares in, your business 
•  you are being taken over completely or in part by another organisation 
•  you are splitting out to form new organisations 
 
Annex 8 of this guidance has more information to help you to understand how 
this relates to you. 
 
13.1  You must report either: 
 
•  change of ownership  
•  a merger 
•  a takeover 
•  de-merger  
If you fail to do so, we will take action against you. Any action could lead to 
any migrants you sponsor having their leave curtailed. 
 
This report must be made by your level 1 user using your SMS account. If 
your level 1 user is not available because you have been taken over or

sponsored migrants are moving to a new organisation, you must: 
•  report the change via your sponsorship management system (SMS) 
account, including details of all of your sponsored migrants who will be

moving to a new organisation - you must make the report within 20 
working days of the change 
•  use the migrant reporting facility on the SMS to report if any of your 
sponsored migrants are not moving to the new sponsor - these migrants’ 
leave will be curtailed 
•  confirm if you need to surrender your sponsor licence - this can be done 
using your SMS account or using the change of circumstances form  
•  the ‘What is the sponsorship management system’ section for more 
information on the SMS 
If you have completely taken over, or merged with another sponsor 
organisation and their sponsored migrants are moving to you, you: 
•  must make a valid application for a sponsor licence as set out in the 
‘Mergers, takeovers and similar changes’ section within 20 working days 
of the date they move to you 
•  can use the SMS to apply for an increase in your allocation of certificates 
of sponsorship (CoS), if you already have a sponsor licence, and the 
change means that you may need to recruit more migrants in the future 
•  must report the change via SMS, including details of any migrants you 
have accepted sponsorship responsibility for, if you already have a 
sponsor licence - you must make the report within 20 working days of the 
change taking place 
13.7  We can give you limited access to the old sponsor’s licence on the SMS, so 
that you can report migrant activity for those whose employment has 
transferred to you. 
 
"
75,Partial takeovers and de-mergers,"13.8  This section explains what must happen if you are partially taken over, or if 
you are splitting out to form one or more new organisations and some of your 
sponsored migrants will be moved to a new organisation under TUPE or 
similar protection. 
If the sponsor no longer needs its sponsor licence 
If you are the existing sponsor and the change means that you will no longer 
have any sponsored migrants, you: 
 
•  must report the change using the SMS, including details of migrants 
moving to the new organisation, within 20 working days of the change 
•  may want to surrender your licence - this can be done by using the SMS 
or the change of circumstances form 
 
The ‘What happens if my circumstances change’ section has more 
information. 
 
13.10  If the change leaves you with no sponsored migrants, but you are not sure 
whether you will need to sponsor any new migrants in the future, you can keep 
Page 64 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
your licence if you want to. If you do keep it, we will reduce your allocation of 
(CoS) to zero. If you surrender your licence but then need to recruit migrants 
again in future, you will have to apply for a new licence. 
 
13.11  If you are the new organisation ‘sponsor’, you: 
 
•  must make a valid application for a sponsor licence as set out in the ‘What 
happens if I am involved in a merger, takeover or de-merger’ section 
within 20 working days of the date they move to you 
•  can use the SMS to apply to increase your allocation of CoS if you already 
have a sponsor licence and the change means that you may need to 
recruit more migrants in the future 
•  must report the change via SMS, including details of any migrants you 
have accepted full sponsorship responsibility for, within 20 working days of 
the change taking place 
 
13.12  As the new sponsor, you will not be able to report on the migrants who have 
transferred to you from the old sponsor organisation through SMS, because 
you will not have a SMS record for them. You must report on these migrants to 
meet your sponsor duties. You must email the Tier 2 and 5 Migrant Reporting 
team with the following: 
 
•  old sponsor organisation’s name 
•  old sponsor organisation’s licence number if known 
•  migrants’ details 
•  details of any changes – for example, a migrant is absent from work for 10 
consecutive working days without permission 
 
If the existing sponsor still needs its sponsor licence 
 
13.13  If you are the existing sponsor, you must: 
 
•  report the change via SMS, including details of migrants who will be 
moving to the new organisation, within 20 working days of the change 
taking place 
•  tell us if you need to amend your allocation of CoS via your SMS account 
– for example, if you will need fewer CoS than was agreed before the 
change 
•  continue to report on any sponsored migrants you are still employing, 
although you will no longer have any responsibility for reporting on 
migrants who moved to the new organisation 
 
13.14  If you are unsure whether, or when you may need to recruit any new migrants 
in future, we will reduce your allocation of CoS to zero. 
 
13.15  If you are the new organisation (sponsor), you: 
 
Page 65 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  must make a valid application for a sponsor licence as set out in the ‘What

already have a sponsor licence and the change means that you may need 
to recruit more migrants in the future 
•  must report the change via SMS, including details of any migrants you 
have accepted full sponsorship responsibility for - you must make the 
report within 20 working days of the change taking place 
 
13.16  As the new sponsor, you will not be able to report on the migrants that have 
moved from the old sponsor organisation, because you will not have a SMS 
record for them. You must report on these migrants to meet your sponsor 
duties.  
 
You must email the Tier 2 and 5 Migrant Reporting team with the following: 
•  old sponsor organisation’s name 
•  old sponsor organisation’s licence number if known 
•  migrants’ details 
•  details of the change – for example, if a migrant has been absent for more 
than 10 consecutive working days without your permission

14 Sponsor duties 
 
What are my duties as a licensed sponsor? 
14.  As a licensed sponsor, you will benefit directly from migration and we expect 
you to play your part in ensuring that the system is not abused. This means 
that you must fulfil certain duties. Some of these duties apply to all sponsors, 
whilst others are specific to those licensed under certain tiers or categories.  
The objectives of these duties are to: 
•  prevent abuse of assessment procedures 
•  capture early any patterns of migrant behaviour that may cause concern  
•  address possible weaknesses in process which can cause those patterns  
•  monitor compliance with Immigration Rules 
14.1  This document reflects current policy but can change at any time. We will let 
you know of any change through the sponsorship management system (SMS) 
message board. The ‘What is the sponsorship management system’ section 
for more information on the SMS. 
 
When do my sponsor duties start and finish? 
14.2  Your responsibilities as a sponsor start on the day we grant your licence and 
•  you surrender your licence 
•  we revoke your licence 
 
14.3  Your responsibility for each migrant starts on the day you assign a CoS to 
14.4  Your responsibility for each migrant ends: 
 
•  when you tell us that you are no longer sponsoring them for any reason 
•  when they leave the UK and their entry clearance or leave to remain 
lapses 
•  when they are granted further leave to remain with a different sponsor, or 
in another immigration category, which means that you do not need to 
sponsor them under Tier 2 or Tier 5 anymore 
 
 
 
end if: 
them.

15 Duties that apply to all sponsors  
 
Record keeping duties 
15.  You must keep the following records or documents, and make them available 
to us on request: 
•  a photocopy or electronic copy of the relevant page, or pages, of each 
sponsored migrant’s passport or travel document and biometric residence 
permit (if issued) that show their entitlement to work including their period 
of leave to remain in the UK – the ‘Right to work checks: employer 
guidance’ page on GOV.UK has more information on this 
•  each sponsored migrant’s contact details - up to date UK residential 
address, telephone number and mobile telephone number – Appendix D 
of the guidance for sponsors has more information on record-keeping 
15.1  You must give us, when asked, any documents relating to your sponsored 
migrants or the running of your organisation that we consider relevant to 
assessing your compliance with your duties as a sponsor. We might, for 
example, ask for details of your recruitment practices so that we can make 
sure that a resident labour market test was carried out correctly. If you fail to 
provide the documents when asked or within a specified timeframe, we will 
take action against you. 
 
15.2  A biometric residence permit is an immigration document issued by the Home 
15.3 
Office to migrants who have been granted entry clearance for more than 6 
months or leave to remain. It contains details of the holder’s immigration 
status, fingerprints and facial image. Where the migrant has a biometric 
residence permit, you must keep a copy. More information on ‘Biometric 
residence permits’ is available on GOV.UK.  
 
If you sponsor a child aged under the age of 18, you must keep a copy of the 
letter from their parents or legal guardian, or just one parent if that parent has 
sole legal responsibility for the child. This should consent to the arrangements 
for the child’s application, travel, reception and care arrangements in the UK. 
Children aged 16 and 17 have the legal right to live independently in the UK, 
and may make their own arrangements for accommodation, but they need the 
consent of their parent(s)/legal guardian to do this and to travel to the UK if 
applying from overseas.

"
81,Reporting duties,"15.4  You must report certain information or events to us using the sponsorship 
management system (SMS), within any time limit set. Any information reported 
about a migrant’s non-attendance, non-compliance or disappearance will be 
used to take enforcement action against them.  
15.5  You must report the following within 10 working days: 
•  if a sponsored migrant does not turn up for their first day of work - you 
must include any reason given for their non-attendance, for example, a 
missed flight  
•  if a sponsored migrant’s contract of, or for, employment or services, or 
registration with a relevant body, is terminated earlier than shown on their 
certificate of sponsorship (CoS) - for example, if the migrant resigns or is 
dismissed; you must include the name and address of any new employer 
that the migrant has moved to, if known 
•  if you stop sponsoring a migrant for any other reason, such as: 
o  you become aware that they have moved into an immigration route 
that does not need a sponsor 
o  they are absent from work without pay for 4 weeks or more, and this 
absence is not covered by the exceptions in ‘Unpaid leave and 
reductions in salary’ 
•  if there are any significant changes in the sponsored migrant’s 
circumstances, for example: 
o  a promotion or change in job title, or core duties, other than those 
which need a change of employment application  
o  a change of salary from the level stated on the CoS, other than 
changes due to annual increments or bonuses 
o  a change of salary from that stated on the CoS for one of the reasons 
given in the ‘Unpaid leave and reductions in salary’ section 
o  the location they are employed at changes - this includes where a 
sports player moves on loan 
•  if a sponsored migrant’s employment is affected by TUPE or similar 
protection – for example, if you are involved in a merger or demerger 
•  if the size or charitable status of your business changes – for example: 
o  you were a large company but you now qualify as a small company or 
have gained charitable status 
o  you were a small company but are now a large company 
o  you previously held charitable status but have ceased to do so 
 
If you are reporting any changes referred to in the first 3 bullet points above, you 
must include the last recorded residential address and contact telephone number for 
the migrant, and any personal email addresses you have for them.  
 
15.6 
If a sponsored migrant is absent from work for more than 10 consecutive 
working days without permission, you must report this within 10 working days 
of the 10th day of absence. 
If there are any significant changes in your own circumstances, for example, if

you sell all or part of your business, stop trading, go into administration, 
substantially change the nature of your business, are involved in a merger or 
are taken over, you must report this within 20 working days.  
 
15.8  You must give the police any information that suggests any migrant you are 
sponsoring, or endorsing under any tier, may be engaged in terrorism or 
criminal activity. 
15.9  You must report details of any third-party intermediary, whether in UK or 
abroad, that has assisted you in the recruitment of migrant employees. 
"
82,Complying with the law,"15.10  To make sure you are complying with our immigration laws, you must: 
•  only employ migrants who are appropriately qualified, registered or 
experienced to do the job, or in respect of a Tier 2 (General) migrant, will 
be, by the time they begin the job - such as if the migrant is working as a 
doctor, you must make sure that they have the correct registration that 
allows them to practise legally in the UK 
•  you must keep a copy of any registration document, certificate or 
reference that confirm they meet the requirements of the specific job, and 
give this to us on request - we may request further information or evidence 
from you or the migrant to confirm this requirement 
•  not employ migrants where they don’t have the experience or permission 
to do the job in question, and stop employing any migrants who for any 
reason are no longer entitled to do the job 
•  not assign a CoS where there is no genuine vacancy or role which meets 
the Tier 2 or 5 criteria - if you assign a CoS and we do not consider that it 
is for a genuine vacancy, we reserve the right to suspend your licence, 
pending further investigation which may result in your licence being 
revoked  
•  only allow the migrant to undertake the specific role set out in their CoS 
•  only assign a CoS to migrants who you believe will meet the requirements 
of the tier or category, and are likely to comply with the conditions (rules) 
of leave  
•  disclose if you assign a CoS to a family member of anyone else within the 
sponsor organisation if it is classed as a small or medium sized business, 
or if you are aware that you are assigning a CoS to a family member of 
anyone else within a sponsor organisation classed as a large business - 
this should be done via the ‘notes’ field on the CoS 
•  only employ migrants in a shortage occupation listed in Appendix K to the 
Immigration Rules if you qualify to sponsor the migrants, where there are 
restrictions on who can sponsor them 
•  comply with UK employment law, for example, National Minimum Wage 
and paid holiday entitlement 
•  hold suitable planning permission or Local Planning Authority consent to 
run your type/class of business at your trading address (where this is a 
Local Authority requirement) 
Page 70 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
•  if you are a food business, be registered with or approved by the relevant 
food authority 
•  if you are employing a migrant who is working for you on a Work Permit, 
you must comply with all associated conditions, for example, you must pay 
them at or above the rate of pay shown on the Work Permit 
•  only assign a CoS to a migrant if you are satisfied that they intend and are 
able to fill the role 
•  where applicable, only assign a CoS for a role which is at or above the 
minimum skill level as set out in this guidance 
•  only employ a migrant who has had a Disclosure and Barring Service 
(DBS) check, where this is a requirement for the role 
"
83,Genuine vacancy,"15.11  A genuine vacancy is one which: 
 
 
•  requires the jobholder to perform the specific duties and responsibilities for 
the job and meets all of the requirements of the tier and category - if you 
have already assigned a CoS, the vacancy must be for the period of 
employment stated on the CoS  
•  does not include dissimilar and/or lower-skilled duties  
 
We may request additional information and/or evidence from you or the 
migrant to establish that this requirement is met, and may refuse the migrant’s 
application if this is not provided within our deadline. 
Examples of vacancies that are not considered to be genuine include but are 
not limited to: 
•  one which contains an exaggerated or incorrect job description to 
deliberately make it appear to meet the requirements of the tier and 
category when it does not 
•  for a job or role that does not exist in order to enable a migrant to come to, 
or stay in, the UK 
•  advertisements with requirements that are inappropriate for the job on 
offer, and have been tailored to exclude resident workers from being 
recruited  
 
"
84,Co-operating with us,"15.12  You must co-operate and allow our staff full access to any premises or site 
under your control on demand. If any migrants you sponsor work at a third 
party’s premises, you must also ensure that they are aware of the possibility of 
visits and checks being conducted at their premises and ensure their full 
cooperation. Visits, including to a third party’s premises, may be prearranged 
or unannounced. Co-operation includes your, and any third party’s, acceptable 
behaviour on visits.  
 
We will not tolerate: 
 
•  swearing and offensive language

You must minimise the risk of immigration abuse by complying with any good 
practice guidance for sponsors produced with our agreement. 
15.13  All duties listed above in this section apply to all sponsors. Those below apply 
only to Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra-company Transfer). 
Tier specific duties under Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra-
Company Transfer) 
15.14  Some Tier 2 (General) migrants are subject to an annual limit. You must apply 
for a ‘restricted certificate of sponsorship (CoS)’ if you wish to sponsor them. 
Migrants who are not subject to the annual limit can be sponsored using an 
‘unrestricted CoS’. You must also understand the different requirements for 
assigning a restricted or unrestricted CoS. 
 
You must not assign: 
•  a restricted CoS to a migrant for any job other than the one you described 
in your application for that restricted CoS 
•  a restricted CoS where an unrestricted CoS is needed 
•  an unrestricted CoS where a restricted CoS is needed 
15.15  When you assign a CoS under Tier 2 (General) you guarantee one of the 
following: 
•  you carried out a genuine resident labour market test in accordance with 
the rules in force at the time 
•  the job is exempt from the resident labour market test 
•  the job appeared in a UK-wide shortage occupation listed in Appendix K to 
the Immigration Rules, on the date that you assigned the CoS 
•  if the job is in Scotland, the job appeared in a shortage occupation listed 
for Scotland in Appendix K to the Immigration Rules, on the date that you 
assigned the CoS 
 
You also guarantee all of the following:

85,Tier specific duties under Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer),
86,Non-EEA trained nurses and midwives,"15.17  If you wish to sponsor a migrant in standard occupational classification (SOC) 
code ‘2231 Nurses’ or ‘2232 Midwives’ as a pre-registration nurse or midwife, 
you must ensure that they complete the appropriate steps to achieve 
registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) within an 8-month 
timeframe.  
 
15.18  Since October 2014, a nurse or midwife trained outside the European 
Economic Area (EEA) must either hold a qualification that is comparable to the 
NMC’s standards of proficiency or pass the NMC test of competence. This test 
will assess the candidate’s qualifications, training and experience against the 
NMC’s standards to ensure that they are capable of practising safely and 
effectively in the UK. It also considers whether the candidate has the 
necessary post-qualifying practice and experience in each appropriate area of 
nursing or midwifery.  
 
15.19  This section provides a summary of the registration process. However, the 
process is subject to change and you must refer to the Trained outside the 
EEA page on the NMC website for full, up-to-date details.  
 
"
87,Timeframe for achieving NMC registration,"15.20  For the purposes of Tier 2 (General), non-EEA trained nurses and midwives 
must complete NMC registration within 8 months of either of the following 
dates: 
•  for a certificate of sponsorship (CoS) assigned to a migrant to support an 
initial Tier 2 (General) application to work in the UK as a nurse or midwife: 
the employment start date stated on their CoS 
•  for a CoS assigned to a migrant to continue working as a nurse or midwife 
under Tier 2 (General): start date of their previous employment 
Page 73 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
15.21  If the migrant fails to achieve registration within 8 months of either of these 
dates, you must stop sponsoring them. You must not sponsor a migrant who 
has previously been sponsored by a different sponsor if they have failed to 
achieve full NMC registration within the timeframes specified above. 
 
"
88,Summary of the registration process,"15.22  The table below summarises the steps a nurse or midwife trained outside the 
EEA must complete to demonstrate that they are capable of safe and effective 
practice as a nurse or midwife in the UK. You must ensure that the migrant 
completes these steps within the 8-month timeframe outlined above if you 
wish to sponsor, or continue sponsoring, them. 
 
Requirement 
 
Qualification  
Details 
 
The candidate must have completed a 
nursing or midwifery training programme 
leading to registration in their home country 
as an entry-level registered nurse or 
midwife. 
 
Unless that qualification has been deemed 
comparable to the NMC’s standards of 
proficiency, they will also need to complete 
a two-part test of competence:  
 
•  Part 1 is a multiple-choice computer-
based test (CBT) administered on 
behalf of the NMC by a third party and 
can be taken in a test centre in most 
countries around the world 
•  Part 2 is a practical nursing or 
midwifery examination known as the 
objective-structured clinical 
examination (OSCE). The OSCE is 
only available at NMC-approved OSCE 
test centres in the UK 
 
The candidate will need to meet the health 
and character requirements for safe and 
effective practice – see Character and 
health decision-making guidance on the 
NMC website for details. 
 
The candidate must demonstrate that that 
they have the necessary knowledge of the 
English language for safe and effective 
practice as a nurse or midwife in the UK.

Payment  
 
See the English language requirements

The candidate will need to confirm that 
there is in force, or will be in force, cover for 
them under an appropriate indemnity 
arrangement.  
 
Payment of the evaluation fees and the 
registration fee.  
 
 
"
89,Objective-structured clinical examination (OSCE),"15.23  Where required, the candidate will be invited to sit the OSCE in one of the 
approved NMC UK OSCE test centres.  
 
15.24  Candidates may sit the OSCE up to 3 times as part of one application for 
registration. 
 
between attempts. 
 
15.25  If the candidate is unsuccessful, they must wait a minimum of 10 working days 
15.26  If the candidate is unsuccessful after their 3 permitted attempts, their OSCE 
application will close. If they still wish to register as a nurse or midwife, they 
will be required to submit a new application to the NMC but will not be able to 
sit the OSCE again for a minimum of 6 months.  
 
15.27  A candidate who fails the OSCE 3 times is unlikely to be able to achieve their 
NMC registration within the 8-month timeframe indicated above. In such 
cases, you must immediately stop sponsoring them.  
 
15.28  If you cease sponsorship for this, or any other, reason, you must tell us via 
your sponsorship management system (SMS) account within 10 working days. 
If you fail to do so, we may revoke your sponsor licence.  
 
15.29  See ‘Reporting duties’ for further information.  
 
"
90,Completion of registration,"15.30  Once the candidate completes all the registration requirements, the NMC will 
send them their registration number or personal identification number (PIN). 
You must retain a copy of their PIN notification. 
 
15.31  You must tell us within 10 working days through your SMS account of the 
migrant’s full NMC registration, confirmation that the migrant is now 
undertaking the role of a registered nurse or midwife, and is being paid at 
least:  
•  if they are a nurse, whichever is the higher of: 
o  £20,800 per year, or 
Page 75 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
o  the NHS Agenda for Change Band 5 rate set out in Table 9 of 
Appendix J to the Immigration Rules 
•  if they are a midwife, whichever is the higher of: 
o  £30,000 per year (or £20,800 per year if they qualify as a new 
entrant), or 
o  the NHS Agenda for Change Band 5 rate set out in Table 9 of 
Appendix J to the Immigration Rules 
 
"
91,Overseas Nursing Programme,"15.32  We have identified that there are some non-EEA migrants in the UK who have 
been sponsored and granted Tier 2 (General) leave on the basis that they 
intended to complete the Overseas Nursing Programme (ONP) and obtain 
registration with the NMC. We are aware that some of these migrants failed to 
apply to the NMC for permission to undertake the ONP.  
 
15.33  It is now too late for these migrants to apply to undertake the ONP as it closed 
to new entrants on 31 March 2015. If these nurses have not yet obtained NMC 
registration, you must stop sponsoring them. If you continue to employ a 
migrant who has not taken the required steps within the specified time, we 
may revoke your sponsor licence. 
 
"
92,Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer),"15.34  When you assign a CoS under Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer (ICT)), you 
guarantee that: 
•  the job is an intra-company transfer 
•  where required, the migrant has been employed for the specified period 
prior to their move 
•  where the migrant will be paid in a currency other than sterling, the salary 
amount entered on the CoS is based on the exchange rate for the relevant 
currency on the day the CoS was assigned, taken from the rates 
published on ‘OANDA’ 
•  the migrant will be paid at or above the appropriate rate (including any 
allowances) for that job as set out in this guidance

16 Documents 
 
What documents must I keep now that I have a sponsor 
licence? 
16. 
To comply with your duties, you must keep certain documents for each 
sponsored migrant. Appendix D of the guidance for sponsors lists these 
documents and says how long you must keep them. The documents can be 
kept in paper or electronic form. If kept electronically, you must make sure that 
all the relevant parts of the document are visible as described in Appendix D. 
16.1  There is no prescribed method for storing the documents, but they must be 
available to us on request. If you fail to keep any documents set out in 
Appendix D and/or fail to give us any documents when we ask for them, we 
will take action against you. 
16.2  Any documents that we ask for which are not in English or Welsh must be 
accompanied by a certified translation. The translator’s credentials should be 
given, along with their official declaration that the translation is accurate. 
 
16.3  Some of the documents you must keep as part of your sponsorship duties may 
also need to be kept for other purposes. You must meet any legal 
requirements for record keeping set by us or another government department. 
 
16.4  You should read our guidance on preventing illegal working, which 
recommends specific documents you should keep and the format in which 
they should be kept. You have responsibilities for this under regulations made 
under section 15 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The 
‘Right to work checks: employer guidance’ page on GOV.UK has more 
information on this. 
 
16.5  You must also be aware of your responsibilities under the General Data 
Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018. The ‘Guide to the 
General Data Protection Regulation’ page on the Information Commissioner’s 
Office website has information on this.

If you have any queries about your sponsorship duties, call us on 0300 123

How will you check that I am complying with my sponsor 
duties? 
17.1  We may visit you to carry out checks before a decision on your licence 
application has been made. We may also conduct checks after the decision 
has been made. This is to make sure that the information you gave is accurate 
and that you are able and continuing to comply with the duties and 
responsibilities of a licensed sponsor. We check that: 
 
•  information given is accurate and complete  
•  you are able to offer employment 
•  you are genuine and trading or operating lawfully in the UK 
•  there are no reasons to believe you represent a threat to immigration 
•  you are committed to, and actually are, complying with all the duties of 
control 
sponsorship 
 
17.2  We may check sponsors at random. If you are checked, it does not 
necessarily mean we have doubts about your compliance as a sponsor. We 
may make these checks before we make a decision on your licence 
application or after your licence has been granted, during the validity period of 
your licence. These visits can be announced or unannounced.  
 
If your migrant workers perform their employment duties at a third party’s 
office, it is your responsibility to ensure that the third party is aware of the 
possibility of unplanned and unannounced visits and checks being conducted 
at their premises and ensure their full cooperation. If any such third party is 
uncooperative, we will take action against you. 
What happens during a check? 
17.4  Our compliance officers carry out the checks and they may visit you and any 
physical addresses where your migrant workers carry out their work (including 
a third party’s offices). 
17.3 
 
 
17.5  The compliance officer may want to: 
 
•  verify any information you gave on your sponsor licence application which 
may include taking photographs of the location and the premises from 
which you are operating your business 
•  verify any information you gave in support of any migrant visa or leave 
applications

17.6  We may also carry out checks on any licensed sponsor by telephone, or by 
letter, asking for evidence to support any information you have given us either 
before or after your licence was granted.

If we have carried out a check before making a decision on your application, 
we will make that decision based on all of the information given by you and

you to let you know the outcome of the check.

who appears to act on your behalf have knowingly deceived us or, cases 
where we cannot verify statements made or documents given to us by these 
individuals. In these cases, we will assess the evidence we have and we may 
take action against you. We may take into account information gained in 
interviews with your employees. 
 
 
 
17.13  We may prosecute you, a representative or a person employed by you who 
appears to act on your behalf under the relevant immigration act or other 
legislation if you or they have attempted deception. We can refuse future 
applications involving the same individuals.

"
101,Allegations of abuse of the sponsorship arrangements,"17.14  If you use deception to get a licence, you may be committing a criminal 
offence. The compliance officer will consider information about abuse of the 
sponsorship arrangements and investigate and, if appropriate, tell the relevant 
authorities. 
17.15  All sponsorship applications are confidential. We will not pass on information 
sent with your application to anyone except other government departments, 
agencies and local authorities where it is needed. However, we will publish 
sponsors’ ratings of A and B on GOV.UK, the ‘Rating sponsors’ section has 
more information. 
17.16  We treat allegations of abuse of the sponsorship arrangements in confidence. 
Anyone with information about abuse of the sponsorship arrangements can 
email the Business Helpdesk.  
 
What will happen if I do not comply with my sponsor 
duties? 
17.17  The majority of those who employ overseas workers are honest and willing to 
comply with their duties. Because sponsorship transfers a significant amount 
of responsibility for selecting migrants to sponsors, we have a duty to ensure 
that we deal appropriately with the minority who do not comply with their 
duties. We place great weight on the importance of trust in the operation of the 
sponsorship system and the need to ensure that sponsors take their duties 
seriously. 
17.18  We have measures to make sure that we enforce sponsors’ duties and identify 
dishonest or incompetent sponsors early. These include your licence being 
suspended, revoked or downgraded, a limit place on the number of CoS you 
can assign or unused CoS being withdrawn.  
17.19  Where we have reason to believe that you have breached your sponsorship 
 
 
 
 
duties, we will consider the nature of the suspected breach. 
 
Where the breach is a minor issue, you are willing and able to correct it, and 
pose no continuing threat to immigration control, we will in most cases support 
you in making the relevant improvements by issuing an action plan which sets 
out the steps you must take in order to retain your licence. 
 
Where there is a serious breach indicating: 
 
•  a significant or systematic failing  
•  you no longer meet the eligibility or suitability requirements for holding a 
licence 
•  we consider that you constitute a serious threat to immigration control  
 
we may decide either to suspend your licence and investigate further or to 
revoke your licence without prior suspension.

102,What will happen if I do not comply with my sponsor duties?,
103,Sanctions for employing illegal migrant workers,"17.21  Employers have a duty to check that their employees have the right to work in 
the UK and to undertake the work in question. We take action against those 
who employ illegal workers and do not undertake the correct checks. You can 
protect yourself by conducting the correct document checks which are set out 
in published guidance. You must do this check before employment starts. If 
you employ someone who has no restrictions on their right to be in the UK and 
work, you only need to make this check once. If the employee has restrictions 
on their right to be in the UK and to do the work in question, you need to 
conduct follow up checks. The ‘Right to work checks: employer guidance’ 
page on GOV.UK has more information on this. 
 
17.22  If you employ workers illegally, you may face the following penalties: 
 
•  we may revoke your sponsor licence and you will then be subject to a 
cooling-off period of 12 months before you can reapply for a licence  
•  we may issue you with a civil penalty of up to £20,000 for each illegal 
worker 
•  if we need to take action to enforce payment of a civil penalty, this could 
adversely affect your ability to obtain credit 
•  you may be prosecuted for having in your possession or under your 
control an identity document (or a copy of it) that is false or improperly 
obtained and you may go to prison for up to 5 years and/or receive an 
unlimited fine 
•  you may be prosecuted for knowingly employing an illegal migrant worker, 
for which you can go to prison for up to 2 years and/or receive an 
unlimited fine 
•  you may be disqualified from acting as a company director 
•  you may be prosecuted for facilitation or trafficking and if convicted, you 
may go to prison for up to 14 years and/or receive an unlimited fine 
•  if you are subject to UK immigration control, and liable for employing 
illegal workers, this will be recorded on Home Office systems and may be 
used in the consideration of future immigration applications

18 Downgrading your licence rating 
If we believe you are not complying with your duties, have knowingly provided 
false statements or false information, or not provided information that you held 
when required to, or that you or the individuals you are sponsoring pose a 
threat to immigration control, we will take action against you. 
If you are rated A (Premium) or A (SME+) and we downgrade your licence to a 
B-rating, we will end your customer services benefits package. 
 
18.2  For information on the circumstances in which we will downgrade your licence 
from an A-rating to a B-rating, see Annex 3 of this guidance. 
 
18.3  For information on the circumstances in which we may downgrade your 
licence from an A-rating to a B-rating, see Annex 4 of this guidance. 
 
Process we will follow in deciding what (if any) action to 
take 
18.4  Unless downgrading of a licence is mandatory, we will take all the facts of the 
case into account when deciding what action to take against you under one or 
more of the circumstances outlined in Annex 4 of this guidance. No two cases 
are alike and we cannot list all the circumstances in which we may downgrade 
your licence, limit the number of certificates of sponsorship (CoS) you are 
allowed to assign or take no action.  
 
18.5 
If we consider downgrading your licence, we will write to you to tell you what 
action we propose and why, giving you 20 working days from the date of that 
letter to respond in writing. We may extend this period at your request if we 
are satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances.  
 
You may make any written statements you think necessary to respond, 
including sending evidence. We will not hold an oral hearing. If new evidence 
comes to light during that period, we will write to you again, giving you another 
20 working days to respond on the new evidence. 
 
18.6  When we receive a response from you, we will consider this and may ask a 
compliance officer, other law enforcement agency, government department, 
agency, local authority, the police, foreign government or other body for 
information. We will tell you of our decision within 20 working days of receiving 
your response. 
 
If we do not receive a response from you within the time allowed, we will go 
ahead with whatever action we believe to be appropriate and will send you our 
decision in writing. Any decision to downgrade your licence will take effect 
from the date of the letter we send to you to tell you about our decision. We 
will send this letter by recorded delivery. The section on ‘Sponsorship action 
plans’ provides more information on how and when you must pay your action 
plan fee.

"
104,Downgrading your licence rating,
105,Process we will follow in deciding what (if any) action to take,
106,Sponsorship action plans,"18.8  A B-rating is a transitional rating. If you are a B-rated sponsor, you must 
improve your performance enough to be upgraded to an A-rating within a 
specified time limit, not exceeding 3 months. If you do not, your licence will be 
revoked. 
If you are awarded a B-rating, you must adhere to an action plan which will set 
out the steps you must take to return to, an A-rating. For example, this might 
include making improvements to your record-keeping, improving your control 
over staff who assign certificates of sponsorship (CoS), or improving 
communication between your different branches so you know when a migrant 
has not turned up for work. 
18.10  There is a fee for an action plan, see the ‘UK visa fees’ page on GOV.UK for 
more information. This fee covers the cost of preparing the action plan. Where 
we decide that a B-rating is appropriate, we will write to tell you, and that 
payment is due for the action plan fee. You will then have 3 options: 
•  pay the fee and accept the action plan - if you do, you must make your 
payment within 10 working days using the ‘Action plan details’ function in 
your SMS account; if you make your payment within 10 working days, you 
will continue to be a licensed sponsor and we will proceed as set out in 
paragraphs below 
•  decline to pay the fee: 
o  if you are not sponsoring a migrant, you can choose to surrender your 
licence - to do this you should select the ‘decline’ option in the ‘Action 
plan payments’ function in your SMS account; you must also sign the 
declaration attached to the letter sent to you, telling you of your B-
rating - this confirms you want to surrender your licence; you must 
return the declaration to us within 10 working days 
o  if you select ‘decline’ but do not return the declaration to surrender 
your licence within 10 working days, we will revoke your licence 
•  do nothing - if you do not pay the fee within 10 working days, your licence 
will be revoked 
 
18.11  Once the fee is paid, we will send you your action plan. During the period 
covered by your action plan, you will not be able to add branches or a new tier 
to your licence. Also, you will not be able to assign any CoS to new migrants 
but may assign a CoS to a migrant: 
Page 84 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  you are already sponsoring who has leave under Tier 2 or Tier 5 and is 
eligible to apply to extend that leave 
•  who holds a valid Work Permit and is already working for you, to apply in 
the Tier 2 (General) category to continue in the same employment with 
you 
We will agree with you, under the terms of your action plan, how many CoS 
you can have to cover extension applications during the period covered by 
your action plan. 
 
18.12  All action plans are set for a fixed period of 3 months. We believe that 3 
months is the maximum length of time needed to put right any issues that 
resulted in you failing to meet your sponsor duties.  
 
After the end of this period, we will visit you to check whether you have met all 
of the requirements in your action plan and if: 
 
•  you have not met the requirements of your action plan, we will revoke your 
licence 
•  you have met all of the requirements of your plan and we have no other 
concerns about you, we will award you an A rating; we will review your 
allocation of CoS where necessary so that you are able to sponsor new 
migrants again if needed 
•  we find other areas of non-compliance have arisen which are not 
addressed by the current action plan, but are set out in this guidance as 
circumstances in which we will, or may award a B-rating - then a new, 
second action plan will be required, you must pay a fee for any further 
action plan 
 
18.13  If you request it, we will visit you before the end of the 3-month period, but you 
should only request this if you are certain you have already met all of the 
requirements set out in your action plan. If you request an earlier visit, we will 
take the action set out in paragraph 18.12, whether or not the 3-month period 
has ended. Subject to paragraph 18.14, we will only visit you once to check 
that you have met all those requirements. 
18.14  During the period covered by your action plan, we reserve the right to carry out 
additional compliance visits if we have information or evidence to suggest that 
you may be failing to meet your sponsor duties for a reason not covered by 
your current action plan. 
 
18.15  We will closely monitor your use of any CoS that you assign whilst B-rated. If 
we find either during the life of your action plan, or later, that you have used 
any of those CoS to sponsor a new migrant, we will revoke your licence. 
18.16  You can only be B-rated and subject to an action plan for a maximum of: 
 
 
 
•  3 months at any one time in respect of any single action plan  
•  2 times during the validity period of your licence

Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
 
18.17  If you have been B-rated and subject to an action plan twice within the validity 
period of your licence and we have any further concerns about you which are 
set out in Annex 3 of this guidance as circumstances in which we will award a 
B-rating, we will revoke your licence. The validity period of your licence is the 
4-year period for which it was first granted and each subsequent 4-year period 
after a successful renewal. 
18.18  When you renew your sponsor licence, if the period covered by your action 
plan starts during the period of your old licence, and ends during the period of 
your renewed licence, you will be treated as having been B-rated during your 
new licence and this will count towards the number of times you are allowed to 
be B-rated during the period of your renewed licence.

licensed under. 
If any circumstances in Annex 5 of this guidance arise, we will revoke your 
licence and may do so immediately. We will write to you to tell you that your 
licence has been revoked. There is no right of appeal and you will not be 
allowed to apply again for a sponsor licence until the end of the appropriate 
cooling-off period from the date your licence is revoked. If we do not revoke 
your licence immediately, we will suspend your licence pending further 
investigation. For more information, please see suspending a licence. 
 
19.2  For information on the circumstances in which we may revoke your sponsor 
licence, see Annex 6 of this guidance. 
 
19.3  We cannot define in which exceptional circumstances we may not revoke your

that you have robust processes and procedures in place and have taken all 
reasonable steps to verify information that you are required to obtain and hold 
in connection with your duties under this guidance, as well as any information 
that you send to us.  
 
If the circumstances in Annex 6 of this guidance arise and we believe that the 
evidence we have shows that you are breaching your duties and/or pose a 
threat to immigration control, we will suspend your licence. For more 
information, please see suspending a licence.

20 Suspending a licence 
If we believe you are breaching your duties and pose a threat to immigration 
control, for example, assigning certificates of sponsorship (CoS) to migrants 
who do not qualify to come to the UK, we may suspend your licence while we 
make further enquiries. 
 
20.1  You will not be able to assign any CoS while your licence is suspended. You 
must continue to comply with all sponsor duties and any requirements set out 
in this guidance, throughout the period of suspension. If your licence is due to 
expire during the period of suspension, you must still apply to renew it if you 
want to keep it. 
If your licence is suspended, it is suspended in all the tiers and categories you 
are licensed under and we will remove your entry from the public version of 
the register of sponsors during the suspension period. 
Migrants who you are sponsoring at the time of the suspension won’t be 
affected, unless we decide to revoke your licence. 
If we decide to revoke your licence, we will write to you to tell you of this. 
There is no right of appeal and you won’t be allowed to apply for a sponsor 
licence again until the end of the appropriate cooling-off period from the date 
your licence is revoked. 
If we decide not to revoke your licence, we will lift the suspension and 
reinstate your entry on the public version of the register of sponsors on the 
GOV.UK website. 
 
Process we will follow in deciding what (if any) action to 
take 
20.5  Where any of the criteria arise listed in Annex 6 as those which ‘may’ result in 
revocation of your licence, we will first consider downgrading your licence. 
However, we may decide to suspend your licence without first downgrading it. 
For more information, please see downgrading to a B-rating. 
If we suspend your licence, the process will then continue in one of the 
following ways: 
Process 1 
20.7  Where we are satisfied that we have enough evidence to suspend your licence 
without further investigation, we will write to you giving reasons for the 
suspension. 
 
20.8  You have 20 working days from the date of the written notification, to respond 
to our letter. This is your opportunity to seek a review of our decision and to 
set out any mitigating arguments you believe exist. Your response to us must 
be made in writing and set out, with supporting evidence, which grounds you

114,What happens to my sponsored migrants if my licence is suspended?,
115,Surrendering your licence,
116,Renewing your sponsor licence,
117,How to renew your licence,"22.5  You must apply to renew your licence using your SMS account. You will be 
able to make your renewal application from 90 days before the expiry date of 
your licence. 
 
22.6  You must review the current version of the sponsor guidance to ensure that 
you are aware of any changes that affect you, for example, you must have an 
employee who is a level 1 user, in order to ensure that you will be able to fulfil 
your sponsor duties. You must ensure that you are compliant with any 
requirements that have been introduced since your first licence approval. 
 
22.7  We will write to you 120 calendar days before the expiry of your licence to 
confirm your licence expiry date and tell you that you will soon need to apply to 
renew it. We will write to you again 90 calendar days before the expiry of your 
licence to remind you to renew your licence. 
Page 94 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
 
More reminders to renew your licence will be sent: 
 
•  60 calendar days before it is due to expire  
•  30 calendar days before it is due to expire  
•  14 calendar days before it is due to expire 
 
22.8  There is a fee for renewing your licence. The fee will be the same as it would 
be if you were applying for a licence for the first time. Fees can be found on 
the ‘UK visa sponsorship for employers’ page on GOV.UK. 
This guidance explains that there are different fees for small and large 
companies. Understanding the difference is important because if you pay the 
wrong fee, your application to renew your licence may be rejected. You may 
also be charged incorrect immigration skills charge fees throughout the life of 
your licence. 
 
"
118,How the application process works,"22.9  The licence renewal function in your sponsorship management system (SMS) 
account can only be accessed by a level 1 user. You should talk about your 
licence renewal with your authorising officer before a level 1 user sends your 
application. When the level 1 user sends the application, they will be 
confirming that they have the consent of your authorising officer. 
 
22.10  At the end of the process, the level 1 user will be asked to make an online 
payment to cover the licence renewal fee and print off a summary sheet for 
your information. You do not need to send us any documents at this stage. 
 
22.11  If you pay: 
 
•  the small licence fee when you should have paid the large fee, your 
application will be rejected 
•  the large fee when you should have paid the small fee, your application 
will be accepted and we will refund the difference 
 
22.12  If your application is accepted, we will temporarily extend the expiry date of 
your licence to allow us time to conduct any checks we decide necessary 
before deciding your application. 
 
22.13  The checks we make could include asking you to send us some documents. 
We may want to see any documents listed in Appendix A of the guidance for 
sponsors as mandatory documents for anyone applying for a new sponsor 
licence. We may also ask for other information or documents not listed in 
Appendix A. If we write to you to ask for any information or documents, you 
must send them within 5 working days. 
 
Page 95 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
22.14  If you do not send the documents within this time, we will take action against 
you. This can include: 
•  reducing or removing your CoS allocation 
•  downgrading your licence to a B-rating 
•  suspending your licence pending further investigation 
•  revoking your licence 
 
22.15  We may visit you when you apply to renew your licence. If you are an A-rated 
sponsor at the time you apply and, on our visit, we have concerns about any of 
your actions as sponsor, we will either: 
•  grant your application to renew your licence but downgrade it to a B-rating  
•  revoke your licence - Annexes 5 and 6 of this guidance set out the 
circumstances in which we will, or may, revoke your licence 
 
22.16  If your licence is B-rated at the time you apply, you will remain under your 
sponsorship action plan and we will not make a final decision on your 
application until the period covered by your plan has passed. For example, if 
your licence is due to expire on 1 July 2020, but you are subject to an action 
plan until 30 June 2020, we will not make a final decision on your application 
before 30 June 2020. 
 
22.17  If your licence is suspended but is due to expire, you must still renew it. If you 
don’t renew it and the result of the suspension does not lead to your licence 
being revoked, we will not be able to reinstate your licence if it has expired. 
 
22.18  If we have granted you access to a dormant sponsor licence because you 
have been involved in a merger, takeover or other restructuring exercise, you 
do not need to do anything about that dormant licence expiring. You will 
continue to be able to access it until the last grant of leave for a migrant 
sponsored under that licence has expired. 
 
"
119,Timing your licence renewal application,"22.19  We recommend that you renew your licence early, or at least one month 
before the expiry date. If you apply in good time, you will have the chance to 
apply again if your application is rejected. If your licence has expired when we 
make a decision to reject or refuse your application, you will not be able to 
make another application to renew your licence. 
 
22.20  If you delay your renewal application and it is rejected, you risk the possibility 
that your licence expiry date will have already passed and you will not be able 
to make another application to renew because it will have expired. Paragraph 
22.2 above has more information on the consequences of your licence 
expiring. 
 
"
120,Declining to renew your licence,"22.21  You may decline to renew your licence because you no longer sponsor any 
migrants and do not intend to sponsor any in the future. 
Page 96 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
22.22  The renewal function in your SMS account includes an option to ‘decline’ to 
renew your licence. If you choose to decline and work through this process to 
its end, you will not be able to change your mind afterwards and your licence 
will expire on its due date. Nothing can be done to change or reverse this. 
 
22.23  If you decline to renew your licence, either deliberately or in error, once it has 
expired, we will curtail the leave of any migrant you were sponsoring, normally 
to 60 calendar days. Paragraph 22.2 above has more information. 
 
22.24  If you do successfully apply again for a new licence, you cannot continue to 
sponsor migrants as though nothing has happened. You are in the same 
position as a newly licensed sponsor and if you want to employ a migrant 
again, where appropriate you must first carry out a resident labour market test 
properly, unless an exemption applies. 
 
22.25  If the resident labour market test shows there are no suitable settled workers 
available to fill the post, or there is an exemption from the resident labour 
market test, only then can you continue to employ that migrant. You must 
assign a new CoS to them and they must apply for leave to remain in the UK 
before their current leave expires. If a Tier 2 or Tier 5 migrant’s leave expires 
before they make a further application, they will have to leave the UK or face 
enforced removal.

23 Certificate of sponsorship 
 
What is a certificate of sponsorship? 
23.  A certificate of sponsorship (CoS) is not a paper certificate or document, but a 
virtual document, like a database record. When you have followed all of the 
rules set out in this guidance and you are ready to sponsor a migrant under 
Tier 2 or Tier 5, you must assign a CoS to them using your sponsorship 
management system (SMS) account. This involves working through a short 
online form where you give us information about the migrant you want to 
sponsor and the work they will do. All of the information you enter will be 
stored and can be viewed by us. A CoS can only be assigned by a person who 
has access to the SMS as a level 1 or level 2 user. 
 
23.1  When you assign a CoS, a reference number is generated and you must give 
this number to the migrant you want to sponsor. They must then include the 
reference number in their application for entry clearance if outside the UK, 
leave to remain under Tier 2 or Tier 5 if inside the UK. When you give the CoS 
number to the migrant, you should treat it as a secure and confidential 
document. 
 
23.2  The migrant may ask for other information that was part of the process of 
generating the reference number. You can give the migrant a copy of their 
CoS, although they don’t need it, and there is a function within your SMS 
account to print any CoS you have assigned. You can do this by using the 
‘View CoS’ function, where you can open the CoS and choose ‘Print’. The 
‘SMS user guide’ has more information on how to use this function. 
 
23.3  As the Tiers 2 and 5 leave to remain application forms can now only be 
accessed online, any migrants you sponsor may ask you to allow them access 
the Internet at your premises. You should consider allowing them to do so, 
especially if they wouldn’t otherwise have access to the Internet, as failure to 
do so may mean they would not be able to apply to extend their stay in the 
UK. You should also consider offering support, but without giving immigration 
advice, to those who do not have the ability or confidence to use online 
services on their own, so they can complete their application. 
 
23.4  When a CoS you have assigned has been used to support an application, it 
will show in your SMS account as ‘used’ and it cannot then be used again. If 
the migrant’s application is refused and they wish to re-apply, you must assign 
a new CoS to them to quote on their new application. The only exception is 
where the CoS has been assigned to and used by a migrant who is a non-visa 
national and who is entering the UK for no more than 3 months under the Tier 
5 Creative and Sporting visa concession. 
 
If the migrant’s application was rejected or withdrawn, the CoS will still show in 
your SMS account as ‘assigned’. It can then be used again to support a further 
application.

Page 98 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
23.6  Processes are in place at the port of entry for migrants who come to the UK 
under the Tier 5 Creative and Sporting visa concession, if they have not 
applied for entry clearance because they are: 
 
•  non-visa nationals; that is, not nationals who must always have a visa to 
enter the UK – see Appendix V.2 to the Immigration Rules 
•  seeking entry to the UK for 3 months or less 
 
23.7  Under the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Creative and Sporting, you can assign a 
‘group CoS’ to all members of a group. The ‘Assigning a CoS under Tier 5 in 
the creative and entertainment sector’ section has more information about a 
group CoS. 
 
23.8  Once you have assigned a CoS, it can be used by the migrant you have 
assigned it to in support of their application at any time during the 3-month 
period from the date it was assigned. During this period, a migrant cannot be 
assigned another CoS by any other sponsor. If the migrant does not use the 
CoS within this 3-month period to make an application, it will expire and will 
show as ‘expired’ in your SMS account. Please note, that a migrant cannot 
apply for Tier 2 or Tier 5 leave more than 3 months in advance of the start 
date stated on their CoS. 
 
23.9  The start date given on the CoS must be the date that the migrant is expected 
to start working for you at the time the CoS is assigned. 
 
If such start date for a Tier 2 (General) migrant is subsequently changed after 
leave has been granted, it must be within 28 days from the later of: 
 
•  the date on which their entry clearance or leave to remain is granted 
•  the start date on their CoS (taking into account any changes to start date 
properly reported before leave is granted) 
 
23.10  Assigning a CoS does not guarantee that the migrant will succeed in being 
granted entry clearance or leave to remain. They must meet all of the criteria 
for the Tier 2 or Tier 5 leave they are applying for. 
 
23.11  Before assigning a CoS, you should talk to the migrant about their current 
immigration status, as this may affect any application they make because of 
the rules on switching (‘changing’) from one immigration category to another. 
The rules on switching for Tier 2 and Tier 5 migrants can be found in ‘Part 6A 
of the Immigration Rules’ on GOV.UK. 
 
 
How many certificates of sponsorship will I be allowed to 
assign? 
23.12  When applying for a licence, we ask you for an estimate of the number of 
certificates of sponsorship (CoS) you may assign in your first year in each tier, 
category or subcategory. You must justify your request. 
23.13  You can only have an annual allocation of Tier 2 (General) CoS for the

should not have been assigned, for example, if it was assigned through 
misrepresentation or fraud. 
 
23.26  You can withdraw a CoS assigned to a migrant which has not yet been used 
to support an application for leave to enter, or remain in, the UK. This can be

23.27  A migrant can only have one CoS assigned to them at any given time. If you 
have assigned a CoS to a migrant who intended to start working for you, but 
then decided to take up a job offer with a different sponsor, they must contact 
you to arrange the withdrawal of their CoS. This is because the sponsor who 
they want to start work for will not be able to assign a CoS to them until you 
have withdrawn the one you assigned. They must request this in writing or by 
email giving you 5 working days to action this. If you do not action their 
request, they must send a reminder, after which you will have a further 5 
working days. 
 
23.28  If you refuse, or fail to withdraw, the CoS within the set time the migrant can 
ask us to cancel it. We will not cancel it until we have talked to you about why 
you have not done as they have asked. Failure to action this request from a 
migrant, within the set time, may lead to us taking action against you. 
 
23.29  When a CoS is cancelled or withdrawn, the fee will not be refunded and we 
will refuse any application that is supported by that CoS. 
 
23.30  If a migrant is in the UK with entry clearance or leave to remain, we will cancel 
or curtail their leave if we find the CoS which supported their application was 
improperly assigned. If this happens: 
•  their permission to be in the UK as a Tier 2 or Tier 5 migrant will be 
curtailed, normally to 60 days if they were not actively involved in the CoS 
being assigned, or issued improperly 
•  immediately curtailed if they were actively involved

24 Sponsoring migrants 
 
24.  All migrants you wish to sponsor under Tier 2 and Tier 5 must have been 
granted entry clearance before coming to the UK. The only exception is for 
non-visa nationals in the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Creative and Sporting 
subcategory who are seeking entry for less than 3 months. See Tier 5 
(Temporary Worker) Creative and Sporting visa concession for more 
information on this. 
 
24.1  Migrants cannot make a valid application for entry clearance or leave to 
remain in the UK under the Tier 2 or Tier 5 categories without a CoS.   
 
24.2  A CoS is confirmation from you as a licensed sponsor that: 
 
•  you wish to sponsor a migrant 
•  you have met all of the rules set out in this guidance in respect of the 
information you have entered on the CoS 
•  the migrant will be able to make a successful application for permission to 
enter, or remain in, the UK 
 
24.3  We make the final decision on who is allowed to enter, or remain in, the UK 
and this will be based on the requirements of the Immigration Rules. Assigning 
a CoS does not guarantee an application will be granted. 
 
24.4  All payments you make to migrants that you sponsor under Tier 2 or Tier 5 
must be made into their own bank account in the UK or overseas. You must 
not pay them in cash. Pre-paid cards such as FOREX are acceptable, but you 
must be able to give evidence that you have made payments onto the 
migrant’s card. 
 
24.5  For each migrant, you must keep the documents specified in Appendix D of 
the guidance for sponsors. 
 
Tier 2 skilled workers 
24.6  Tier 2 allows UK employers to employ nationals from outside the settled 
workforce to fill skilled jobs which cannot be filled by settled workers. A 
migrant sponsored under any Tier 2 category must not displace a suitable 
settled worker, which means that you can only offer a job to a migrant you 
wish to sponsor under Tier 2 if there is no suitable settled worker available to 
fill the vacancy. 
 
24.7  A settled worker cannot be made redundant to create a vacancy to be filled by 
a Tier 2 migrant. 
 
Skill level for jobs under Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra-
Company Transfer) 
24.8  Apart from the exceptions listed below, migrants sponsored under Tier 2 
(General) and Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer (ICT)) can only work in a skilled

workforce to fill skilled jobs which cannot be filled by settled workers. A 
migrant sponsored under any Tier 2 category must not displace a suitable 
settled worker, which means that you can only offer a job to a migrant you

130,Information on the overseas criminal record certificate requirement,
131,Rates of pay,
132,Appropriate rate for Tier 2 (General),"26. 
The rules concerning rates of pay for Tier 2 (General) migrants are set out in 
paragraphs 79 to 79D of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules. 
 
26.1  Unless an exception as outlined in this section applies, the minimum salary 
you must pay a Tier 2 (General) migrant is whichever is the higher of:  
•  £30,000 per year 
•  the appropriate rate for the job as stated in Appendix J to the Immigration 
Rules  
 
26.2  These thresholds have been set to make sure that the resident labour market 
is not undercut. The rates are in line with current earnings of settled workers 
and are updated regularly to reflect the latest available salary data. 
 
Note: the salary thresholds for skilled workers will change from 1 January 2021 
under the new points-based immigration system. For further information see Annex 9 
of this guidance and ‘The UK's Points-Based Immigration System: Policy Statement’ 
on GOV.UK. 
 
"
133,New entrant rates,"26.3  For most jobs in Appendix J to the Immigration Rules, there are 2 pay 
thresholds. The lower pay threshold is for ‘new entrants’; the other pay 
threshold is for ‘experienced’ workers. If the migrant qualifies as a ‘new 
entrant’, you must pay whichever is the higher of:  
•  £20,800 per year 
•  the appropriate ‘new entrant’ rate specified in Appendix J to the 
Immigration Rules 
 
26.4  The new entrant pay threshold reflects the fact that people in the early stages 
of their career are generally paid less than their more experienced 
counterparts. Unless the CoS is assigned for more than 3 years and one 
month, the new entrant threshold applies if you have met the resident labour 
market test by carrying out a milkround, or the migrant is changing (‘switching’) 
into Tier 2 (General) under the post-study work provisions.  
 
26.5  Unless the CoS is assigned for more than 3 years and one month, the new 
entrant pay threshold also applies if the migrant is under the age of 26 on the 
date of their application for Tier 2 leave. 
 
26.6  You should not sponsor a migrant at the ‘new entrant’ pay threshold if you 
expect that you will want to sponsor them for more than 3 years and one 
month and you will not pay them the experienced rate after this time. 
In all cases, including where the migrant is applying for a period of leave which 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
26.7 
Page 108 of 209  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will bring their total stay under any combination of Tier 2 leave, or as a Work 
Permit holder, beyond 3 years and one month, the ‘experienced worker’ 
threshold must be paid. This means that any worker initially sponsored at the 
‘new entrant’ threshold must be paid at least £30,000 or the ‘experienced 
worker’ rate for their job as specified in Appendix J, whichever is the higher, if 
they are needed for more than three years. This includes where: 
•  the migrant is still under the age of 26, but is applying to extend their stay 
in a Tier 2 category to 5 years 
•  you assign a CoS for more than 3 years and one month 
 
 
"
134,Public service occupation,"26.8 
If the migrant will be sponsored in one of the following public service standard 
occupational classification (SOC) codes, you must pay a minimum of £20,800 
per year or the appropriate rate of pay in the codes of practice in Appendix J to 
the Immigration Rules, whichever is higher: 
•  2217 Medical radiographers 
•  2231 Nurses – but see below if you are sponsoring a pre-registration 
•  2314 Secondary education teaching professionals – subject teachers in 
maths, physics, chemistry, computer science and Mandarin only  
nurse 
•  3213 Paramedics 
"
135,Pre-registration nurses and midwives,"26.9 
If you are sponsoring a pre-registration nurse (SOC 2231) or pre-registration 
midwife (SOC 2232) under Tier 2 (General), you can pay them at the NHS 
Agenda for Change Band 3 rate until they achieve full Nursing and Midwifery 
Council (NMC) registration, provided you confirm that they will sit an objective-
structured clinical examination (OSCE) to obtain NMC registration no later 
than 3 months after the start date on their CoS. You must be able to provide 
evidence of this from the NMC if asked to do so.  
 
26.10  In these circumstances, you can pay the pre-registration nurse or midwife at 
the Band 3 rate until the earliest of the following events:  
•  registration with the NMC is successfully completed 
•  the application for registration is closed 
•  8 months from either:  
o  the start date on their CoS (if it is their first application for Tier 2 entry 
clearance or leave to remain as a pre-registration nurse) 
o  the start date of their previous employment if they are applying for an 
extension to continue working as a pre-registration nurse 
 
26.11  You must confirm that if the migrant achieves full NMC registration, you will 
continue to sponsor them as a nurse or midwife and pay them at least: 
•  if they are a nurse, whichever is the higher of: 
o  £20,800 per year, or 
Page 109 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
o  the NHS Agenda for Change Band 5 rate set out in Table 9 of 
Appendix J to the Immigration Rules 
•  if they are a midwife, whichever is the higher of: 
o  £30,000 per year (or £20,800 per year if they qualify as a new 
entrant), or 
o  the NHS Agenda for Change Band 5 rate set out in Table 9 of 
Appendix J to the Immigration Rules 
 
 
26.12  You must not continue sponsoring a nurse or midwife if they fail to achieve 
NMC registration within 8 months. For further information on the registration 
process, see Non-EEA trained nurses and midwives.  
 
"
136,Transitional arrangements,"26.13  You must pay a minimum of £20,800 per year (or the appropriate rate of pay in 
Appendix J to the Immigration Rules if this is higher than £20,800) if the 
applicant is applying for leave to remain and they: 
 
•  previously had leave as a Tier 2 (General) migrant on the basis of a CoS 
which was assigned to them before 24 November 2016, and 
•  have not been granted entry clearance in this or any other route since 
their grant of leave above 
 
"
137,Appropriate rate for Tier 2 (ICT),"26.14  The rules concerning appropriate rate of pay for Tier 2 (ICT) migrants are set 
out in paragraphs 75 to 75E of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.  
 
"
138,Long-term Staff,"26.15  The minimum salary you must pay to sponsor a migrant in the Tier 2 (ICT) 
for the job as stated in the codes of practice in Appendix J to the Immigration 
Rules, whichever is higher. 
 
26.16  The only exception to this is where the migrant:  
•  is applying for leave to remain in the Long-Term Staff sub-category, 
•  previously had leave as a Work Permit Holder or a Tier 2 (ICT) migrant 
under the rules in place before 6 April 2011, and  
•  has not been granted entry clearance in this or any other route since that 
grant of leave 
 
26.17  In these circumstances, you must pay the appropriate rate specified in 
Appendix J to the Immigration Rules 
 
"
139,Graduate trainee,"26.18  The minimum salary you must pay to sponsor a migrant in the Tier 2 (ICT) 
Graduate Trainee subcategory is whichever is the higher of:  
•  £23,000 per year  
Page 110 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
•  the appropriate rate specified in Appendix J to the Immigration Rules 
 
Salary information on a certificate of sponsorship – all Tier 
2 categories 
26.19  When you assign a CoS to a migrant, you must give 3 pieces of information 
about the salary package: 
 
•  the gross salary figure which must represent the total amount paid to the 
worker, gross of any tax paid whether paid in the UK or overseas, and 
must include any permitted allowances and guaranteed bonuses 
•  a separate figure for the total of all allowances and guaranteed bonuses 
•  a detailed breakdown of each allowance and each guaranteed bonus 
showing their value 
 
Where the migrant is paid hourly, the appropriate salary consideration will be 
based on earnings up to a maximum of 48 hours a week, even if the migrant 
works for longer than this. For example, a migrant who works 60 hours a week 
for £10 per hour would be considered to have a salary of £24,960 (10x48x52) 
and not £31,200 (10x60x52). This migrant would therefore not be awarded 
points for appropriate salary. 
 
26.20  Where the migrant will be working in the UK for fewer than 12 months, the rate 
of pay must be based on an annual salary. For example, earnings of £15,000 
on a 6-month contract would add up to an annual salary of £30,000. 
 
26.21  The figure given for the gross salary must not be inflated in expectation of any 
tax relief, such as relief on expenditure related to the employment, or tax 
incurred by the employment of a resident worker, but not incurred for a 
migrant.  
 
An example of this is if the gross salary package is £21,000, but the migrant 
worker will have the same net package after tax as a resident worker who is 
paid £25,000 before tax, the CoS must show that the salary package is 
£21,000, not £25,000. 
 
26.22  Salary may be paid in the UK or abroad. Where the migrant will be paid from 
abroad in currency other than pounds sterling, the salary entered on the CoS 
must be based on the exchange rate for the relevant currency on the day the 
CoS is assigned, taken from the rates published on ‘OANDA’.  
 
26.23  The salary package on the CoS may also include any guaranteed allowances, 
such as London weighting or accommodation, which will be paid for the 
duration of the applicant’s employment in the UK. These allowances may only 
be included if they would also be paid to a settled worker. There is one 
exception to this: you may also pay Tier 2 (ICT) migrants allowances to cover 
the additional cost of living in the UK and mobility premiums paid as a 
percentage of base pay. 
 
26.24  The salary package on the CoS must not include:

"
140,Salary information on a certificate of sponsorship – all Tier 2 categories,
141,Unpaid leave and reductions in salary,"26.26  Migrants sponsored under Tier 2 or Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) can take short 
periods of unpaid leave but you must stop sponsoring a migrant who is absent 
from work without pay for 4 weeks or more in total in any calendar year. The 
only exceptions to this are where the unpaid absence is for one or more of the 
following reasons: 
•  statutory maternity leave 
•  statutory paternity leave 
•  statutory parental leave 
•  statutory shared parental leave 
•  statutory adoption leave 
•  sick leave 
•  assisting with a national or international humanitarian or environmental 
crisis overseas, provided you agreed to the absence for that purpose 
•  taking part in strike action as part of a legally organised industrial action 
 
26.27  Where you are required to stop sponsoring a migrant who has been absent 
from work without pay for 4 weeks or more, you must report this using your 
sponsorship management system (SMS) account. This applies whether the 
migrant is absent from work over a single period or more than one period 
during any calendar year (1 January to 31 December). The 4 weeks is worked 
out according to the migrant’s normal working pattern. 
 
An example of this is if the migrant works 3 days per week (3 days x 4 weeks), 
it would be 12 working days.  
 
Page 112 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
26.28  If a sponsored migrant wishes to take a longer period of other unpaid leave, 
such as a sabbatical, you must stop sponsoring them and report this using 
your SMS account. 
 
26.29  If you decide to cut a migrant’s salary package to a lower rate than you stated 
on their CoS, such as, if the allowances offered have changed, the new rate 
that you pay to them must meet the current appropriate rate requirements. 
 
26.30  If the new rate is below the appropriate rate, you cannot continue to sponsor 
them and you must report this to us using your SMS account. 
 
26.31  The only exceptions to this rule are where: 
 
 
•  the reduction in salary is due to a period of leave for any reason given in 
paragraph 26.26 above 
•  the reduction is due to the migrant undertaking professional examinations 
to assess whether their skills meet UK standards before starting work for 
you, where the passing of such examinations is a regulatory requirement 
for the job the migrant will be sponsored to do – this could include:  
o  nurses undertaking the objective-structured clinical examination 
o  doctors undertaking the Professional and Linguistic Assessment 
(OSCE) 
Board (PLAB) test 
•  in the case of a Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) migrant, the reduction is 
due to them not being physically present in the UK 
26.32  If the migrant was granted leave under Tier 2 (General) as a ‘high earner’ and 
the reduction in salary takes them below the high earner threshold, the migrant 
must make a new application for leave.

27 Tier 2 (General) 
 
27.  As a Tier 2 (General) sponsor, you will normally be the employer and 
responsible for paying the migrant. There are certain circumstances, such as 
in parts of the creative sector, where there is no direct employer/employee 
relationship. In such circumstances, the migrant must still have a sponsor that 
is able and willing to accept all of the responsibilities and duties associated 
with being their sponsor. 
 
27.1  There will also be circumstances where there is a clear statutory relationship 
between the employing body and a publicly funded body, where the publicly 
funded body can intervene in the running or funding of the employing or 
paying body. In these cases, the publicly funded body can be the sponsor.  
 
Below are 2 examples of this. 
 
Example 1 
A Local Authority has powers of control and direction over self-governing 
schools, so the Local Authority can sponsor teachers in these schools.  
 
Example 2 
A Strategic Health Authority, through its Deanery, Local Education and 
Training Board (LETB) or provider/commissioning organisation, has funding 
control of training posts for doctors and dentists within NHS Trusts, even 
though it is not the paying body. In this case, the Deanery or LETB can be the 
sponsor. 
 
27.2  Where a migrant is not your direct employee, we will look closely at the 
arrangement to make sure that you can fulfil your sponsor duties. We monitor 
you to make sure that you are fulfilling your duties and take action if we find 
that you are not. 
 
The Tier 2 (General) annual limit 
27.3  There is an annual limit of 20,700 certificates of sponsorship (CoS) available 
to sponsors under Tier 2 (General). The limit runs from 6 April each year to 5 
April the following year. 
 
27.4  Unless the migrant qualifies under one of the exceptions in paragraph 27.5 
below, the limit applies to: 
 
overseas  
•  CoS for migrants applying for entry clearance (a visa) to the UK from 
•  CoS for the dependent partner of a migrant who was last granted leave 
under Tier 4, where that dependant is already in the UK and wishes to 
change (‘switch’) into Tier 2 (General)  
 
We call these ‘restricted’ jobs, for which a ‘restricted’ CoS is needed.

apply for a restricted CoS for such migrants  
•  the migrant is being sponsored to work in standard occupational

•  the migrant will be sponsored to work in a PhD-level occupation as listed

28 Resident labour market test 
 
Resident labour market test: Tier 2 (General) 
28. 
The resident labour market test is there to protect the settled workforce and 
means that you must advertise the job you want to recruit for to give settled 
workers a chance to apply. You can only recruit a migrant if either: 
•  you have completed a resident labour market test in accordance with this 
guidance and can show that no suitable settled worker is available to fill 
the job 
•  the job is exempt from the resident labour market test 
 
28.1  A suitable settled worker means any settled worker who has the skills and 
experience you are seeking. If you find that you have more than one candidate 
with all the necessary skills and experience you advertised for, where one is a 
settled worker and the other is a migrant, you must appoint the settled worker 
even if the migrant is more skilled or experienced. The only exception is if the 
job falls within one of the PhD level standard occupation classification (SOC) 
codes listed in Table 1 of Appendix J to the Immigration Rules, when you can 
appoint a migrant if they are the most suitable candidate. 
 
Exemptions from the resident labour market test 
28.2  This section sets out where you do not have to carry out a resident labour 
market test before you can assign a certificate of sponsorship (CoS) under 
Tier 2 (General). 
 
Continuing to work in the same occupation 
28.3 
If the migrant is already working for you and they need to extend their leave in 
the same immigration category to continue working for you in the same 
occupation, you do not need to carry out a resident labour market test. If they 
are changing (‘switching’) immigration categories and are not covered by 
another exemption, you must advertise the post. 
 
Shortage occupations 
28.4  Shortage occupations are ones where there are not enough settled workers to 
fill available jobs in particular sectors. The shortage occupation list in Appendix 
K to the Immigration Rules on GOV.UK is reviewed regularly. The document 
includes a separate list of shortage occupations for Scotland. If you are filling a 
vacancy which is listed only on the shortage occupation list for Scotland, the 
vacancy must be in Scotland. 
 
28.5  You do not have to carry out a resident labour market test before assigning a 
Tier 2 (General) certificate of sponsorship (CoS) to fill a job in a shortage 
occupation in Appendix K to the Immigration Rules. The exception is if the job 
is in the occupation code ‘2231 Nurses’, where you must carry out a resident 
labour market test. You can only assign a CoS for a job on the shortage 
occupation list if the migrant will work for a minimum of 30 hours per week.

Page 116 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
If you are assigning an unrestricted CoS for a nurse, you should select the 
“Have you met the resident labour market test?” option and give details in the 
box below. If you select the shortage occupation option, you will be unable to 
complete this box, which may lead to the nurse’s application being delayed or 
refused. 
 
28.6  You must also meet any additional criteria for employing migrants in shortage 
occupations as specified in Appendix K to the Immigration Rules. 
 
"
149,Post-study work,"28.7  You do not have to carry out a resident labour market test if a migrant you 
want to sponsor is already in the UK and is applying to switch into Tier 2 
(General) leave and has, or was last granted leave to enter, or to remain in, 
the UK under one of the following categories: 
 
•  Tier 1 (Post-Study Work), 
•  Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur), or 
•  Tier 4, provided: 
o  the migrant’s last grant of Tier 4 entry clearance or leave to remain 
was to study at either: 
▪  a higher education provider listed on the Tier 4 register of 
sponsors as ‘Tier 4 sponsor - track record’ 
▪  an overseas higher education institution to undertake a short-
term study abroad programme in the UK 
o  the migrant has: 
▪  completed, or is applying for leave to remain no more than 3 
months before the expected completion date for, a course 
leading to a UK recognised bachelor’s or master’s degree (not a 
qualification of equivalent level which is not a degree)  
▪  completed, or is applying for leave to remain no more than 3 
months before the expected completion date for, a course 
leading to a UK Postgraduate Certificate in Education or a 
Professional Graduate Diploma of Education (not a qualification 
of equivalent level), or 
▪  has completed a minimum of 12 months study in the UK towards 
a UK PhD 
o  the migrant studied for the course or period of research mentioned 
above at a UK recognised or listed body, or one which holds a 
sponsor licence under Tier 4 of the Points Based System, and 
o  the migrant studied, or is studying, for the course mentioned above 
during their last grant of leave or a period of continuous leave which 
includes their last grant of leave 
For full details of the requirements Tier 4 migrants must meet to switch into 
Tier 2 (General), see paragraph 245HD(b)(ii) and 245HD(d) of the Immigration 
Rules and paragraphs 17 to 19 and 107 to 118 of Tier 2 of the points-based 
system: policy guidance.

"
150,High earners,"28.8  You do not have to carry out a test where the total salary package for the job 
will be £159,600 or above. This also applies if a high earner’s salary is cut to 
an amount below the high earner threshold that applied on the date their 
original CoS was assigned – they must make a new application for Tier 2 
leave but you do not have to carry out a resident labour market test. 
 
"
151,Academic leave,"28.9  You do not have to carry out a resident labour market test if you are a higher 
education provider and were previously sponsoring a migrant who is returning 
to resume their post following a period of academic leave. The migrant must 
have previously been granted entry clearance or leave to remain as a Tier 2 
(General) migrant and the break in their employment must have been solely 
due to a period of academic leave. This does not override the rules on cooling-
off periods which will still apply if the migrant is still applying to return to the 
UK. 
"
152,Established researcher,"28.10  You do not have to carry out a resident labour market test if you are a higher 
education provider or Research Council and: 
•  you wish to sponsor a migrant to continue working as a member of an 
•  the migrant has previously worked with the lead researcher as part of their 
existing research team 
team for:  
application, or  
o  a continuous 12-month period immediately before the date of the 
o  12 months during the 24 months immediately before the date of the 
application, if the migrant has had a period of absence for any of the 
following reasons: 
▪  statutory maternity leave 
▪  statutory paternity leave 
▪  statutory parental leave 
▪  statutory shared parental leave 
▪  statutory adoption leave 
▪  sick leave 
▪  assisting in a national or international humanitarian or 
environmental crisis overseas 
▪  taking part in strike action as part of a legally-organised 
industrial action 
"
153,Supernumerary research positions,"28.11  You do not have to carry out a resident labour market test where the job is in a 
supernumerary research position, over and above your normal staffing 
requirements. This is where the migrant has been granted a scientific research 
award or fellowship by either: 
Page 118 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  a third-party organisation, and the award or fellowship cannot be 
transferred to anyone else, or 
•  you (the sponsor) if:  
o  the migrant has been selected through a competitive process on the 
basis of their own research proposal, and 
o  the funding of the research is secured in an agreement between the 
sponsor and a third-party organisation, which includes objectively 
justified requirements that effectively prohibit any settled worker from 
undertaking the role 
This exemption continues to apply after the relevant third-party funding has 
ended, as long as the migrant is being sponsored to continue to undertake the 
same research. 
 
 
"
154,Postgraduate doctors and dentists in speciality training,"28.12  You do not need to carry out a resident labour market test if the migrant: 
 
•  will be sponsored as a doctor in speciality training where their salary and 
the costs of their training are being met by the government of another 
country under an agreement with the UK government 
•  has already started speciality training as a doctor or dentist in the UK and 
they are applying to continue that training or return to that training (with 
the same National Training Number) after an out-of-programme 
experience 
 
You must confirm on the certificate of sponsorship (CoS) that this exception 
to the resident labour market test applies. 
 
28.13  If a speciality training doctor or dentist wishes to undertake an out-of-
programme experience in the UK, then the organisation providing this will 
need to become the new sponsor. You, as the current sponsor, must tell us 
that you no longer have sponsorship responsibilities for the migrant because 
they are taking an out-of-programme experience. If you are the sponsor that is 
offering the out of programme experience, you must have carried out the 
resident labour market test before you assign a CoS. 
 
28.14  When the out-of-programme experience in the UK has finished, the migrant 
may need to return to their speciality training. You must assign a new CoS but 
will not need to carry out a resident labour market test if the migrant is 
returning to the same training programme. You must confirm on the CoS that 
an exception to the resident labour market test applies. If you were the 
sponsor for the migrant when they did their out-of-programme experience, you 
must tell us that you are no longer sponsoring the migrant. 
 
28.15  When a postgraduate doctor or dentist is accepted for speciality training they 
are given a National Training Number (NTN). You must produce this when 
asked for, as evidence that the doctor or dentist was undertaking training 
before the out-of-programme experience. 
Page 119 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
"
155,High value inward investment posts,"28.16  You do not need to carry out a resident labour market test where the job offer 
is for the migrant to work in support of a posting from an overseas firm to you 
in connection with the relocation of a high value business to the UK or a 
significant new inward investment project, where: 
 
•  you were registered in the UK with Companies House no earlier than 3 
years before the date the CoS was assigned 
•  you are the registered branch or wholly owned subsidiary of a business 
which has its headquarters and principal place of business outside the UK  
•  the relocation or inward investment involves new capital expenditure of 
£27 million or the creation of at least 21 new UK jobs  
and you are able to provide evidence of this, if required. You or the overseas 
business of which you are the branch or subsidiary must be the entity directly 
making the investment - for this purpose, working in support of an inward 
investment project does not include the supply of services to a third-party 
client who is making an investment. The capital expenditure or job creation 
does not need to have taken place before you assign the CoS, but you must 
be able to provide evidence that this will take place as part of the existing 
project. 
 
How to carry out the resident labour market test: Tier 2 
(General) 
28.17  Unless an exemption as outlined in this section applies, all jobs must be 
advertised to settled workers for 28 calendar days. You can advertise jobs in 2 
ways: 
 
•  advertise the vacancy for a single continuous period, with a minimum 
closing date of 28 calendar days from the date the advertisement first 
appeared 
•  advertise the vacancy in 2 stages, with each stage being advertised for no 
fewer than 7 calendar days but where both stages total a minimum of 28 
calendar days - below is an example of this 
 
Example 
You could at first advertise the vacancy for 14 calendar days and appoint any 
suitable settled worker who applies. If no suitable settled worker applies, you 
cannot appoint a migrant worker at this stage as you must advertise the 
vacancy for a further 14 calendar days, making 28 calendar days in total. If no 
suitable settled worker applies during either the first or second stage, then the 
resident labour market test has been passed and you can appoint a Tier 2 
migrant. 
 
The vacancy must have been advertised for at least 28 days within the 6 
months before you assign the CoS to a migrant. 
 
28.18  You must place 2 advertisements using the methods set out in this guidance. 
The job advertisement must be in English, unless based in Wales where it 
Page 120 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
"
156,How to carry out the resident labour market test: Tier 2 (General),
157,Advertising and salary rate,"28.22  The salary rate in your advertisement must be a true reflection of what you are 
prepared to pay and the rate you ultimately pay must be in line with the rate 
that was advertised. Unless the transitional provision outlined below applies, 
you cannot advertise at a low rate (for example, the new starter rate) and then 
offer a higher rate to a migrant to allow them to make a successful application. 
Below is an example of this. 
 
Example 
If you advertised a salary rate of £32,000 to £35,000, you can only sponsor a 
migrant if the salary you state on their CoS is within that range. If you want to 
pay a higher salary, you must carry out the resident labour market test again, 
Page 121 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
advertising at the higher rate, as there may be settled workers who would 
apply for the job at the higher rate. 
 
28.23  When deciding the salary range to put in a job advertisement, you should 
consider if you are willing to offer a higher salary to a more experienced 
worker. This is important because the purpose of the resident labour market 
test is to make sure job opportunities are made available to the settled 
workforce.  
 
Transitional provision for jobs advertised before 30 March 2019 
28.24  The appropriate rates of pay in Appendix J to the Immigration Rules were 
updated on 30 March 2019 (see the ‘Rates of pay’ section of this guidance). If 
you advertised a job before 30 March 2019, but you assign a CoS on or after 
that date, you may find that the highest salary stated in your advertisement is 
lower than the new appropriate rate set out in the ‘Rates of pay’ section. If this 
happens, the salary you state on the CoS must meet the new appropriate rate. 
If this is higher than the rate you originally advertised, you do not need to carry 
out a new resident labour market test.  
 
Example 
You advertised a job before 30 March 2019 with a salary range of £32,000 to 
£35,000. At the time the job was advertised, the appropriate experienced 
worker rate for the job as specified in Appendix J to the Immigration Rules was 
£34,500. However, for CoS assigned on or after 30 March 2019, the new 
appropriate rate is £36,000. 
 
In this scenario, as long as you pay the migrant at least £36,000. you do not 
need to carry out a further resident labour market test. 
 
"
158,Evidence of resident labour market test,"28.25  For each recruitment method, where you have carried out the resident labour 
market test, you must keep the documents listed in Appendix D of the 
guidance for sponsors. If you fail to advertise a job vacancy in line with the 
requirements set out in this guidance, we will take action against you. 
 
Resident labour market test: Tier 2 (General) advertising 
methods 
28.26  The following paragraphs describe the different methods of advertising we 
accept when carrying out a resident labour market test. Unless an exemption 
applies, all jobs must be advertised using 2 of the methods set out in this 
section. In many cases, this will be mandatory online advertising through the 
relevant government job-search service (Find a Job, JobCentre Online, or 
Teaching Vacancies), plus one other method. Where advertising through an 
online government job-search service is not mandatory, you can choose any 
of the permitted media to advertise in – for example, you could choose one 
national newspaper and one professional journal. We will also accept 2 
advertisements using the same form of media, for example, advertisements on 
2 different websites, provided the websites meet our criteria for websites.

Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
"
159,Resident labour market test: Tier 2 (General) advertising methods,
160,Relevant online government job-search service,"28.27  Unless an exception listed in paragraph 28.20 applies, one of your 
advertisments must be via a relevant online government job-search service. 
Which service you use depends on where the job is based and the type of job. 
The relevant services are: 
•  Find a Job (which replaced the Universal Jobmatch service from 14 May 
2018) for jobs based in England, Scotland or Wales 
•  JobCentre Online for jobs based in Northern Ireland 
•  the GOV.UK Teaching Vacancies service for teaching jobs based in 
England 
 
28.28  These services will only accept online vacancy advertisements when there is a 
current vacancy at the time the advertisement is placed. If you use rolling 
recruitment programmes, you will need to make sure that your vacancies are 
placed when there are actual posts to fill. You must adhere to the rules set out 
by these services. If your online vacancy advertisement is refused, you will not 
be able to meet the resident labour market test criteria and will not be able to 
assign a CoS. 
 
Find a Job 
28.29  If the job is based in England (other than certain teaching vacancies – see 
below), Wales or Scotland, it must be advertised via the Find a Job service on 
GOV.UK. Jobs are advertised online directly by employers using Advertise a 
Job. 
 
28.30  The standard period for an advertisement to run on Find a Job is 30 days but 
you can set an earlier closing date. The closing date for applications will not be 
visible unless it is included in the job description so if you advertise a job with 
a closing date that is earlier than 30 days from the date it was first advertised, 
you must make sure that it is stated in the job description. In all cases, you 
must ensure that the job is advertised for a minimum total period of 28 days. 
 
JobCentre Online 
28.31  If the job is based in Northern Ireland it must be advertised through JobCentre 
Online on the Department for Communities website. Jobs can also be placed 
via the Employers Online NI website, by email or fax, or by speaking to an 
advisor on the telephone number given on the website. All jobs which are 
advertised on Jobcentre Online are also available to view in Jobs & Benefits 
Offices and JobCentres in Northern Ireland. 
 
28.32  Jobs advertised using JobCentre Online can run for up to 6 weeks. Employers 
are normally contacted after 2 weeks to assess the position, unless you ask 
for a different closing date. The closing date will be shown on the 
advertisement. 
 
Teaching Vacancies 
28.33  Teaching Vacancies is a service, hosted by the Department for Education, for 
publicly funded schools that provide primary and secondary education in 
Page 123 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
England.  
 
28.34  You can satisfy the resident labour market test for teaching jobs based in 
England by advertising via Teaching Vacancies. You can choose to advertise 
via Find a Job instead of, or as well as, Teaching Vacancies. However, if you 
use both services, this will count as one advertisement for the purposes of 
satisfying the resident labour market test and you will still need to advertise via 
one other acceptable medium listed below. 
 
"
161,National newspaper,"28.35  A national newspaper is one published at least once a week and marketed 
throughout the UK or throughout the devolved nation in which the job is 
located. This could be The Scotsman and The Herald, which are suitable 
national newspapers for jobs in Scotland; The Western Mail for jobs in Wales; 
and the Belfast Telegraph for jobs in Northern Ireland. 
 
"
162,Professional journal,"28.36  A professional journal is one published for a particular field and is available 
nationally either through retail outlets or subscription. The journal must be 
published at least once a month and be relevant to the job, this could be: 
 
•  a relevant trade journal 
•  the official journal of a professional occupational body 
•  a relevant subject specific publication 
 
"
163,Milkround for new graduate jobs and internships,"28.37  A ‘milkround’ is an annual recruitment programme where employers from a 
range of sectors visit universities to give presentations and/or interview 
students, usually as part of university careers fairs. If you use a milkround to 
recruit new graduates or interns, you must visit a minimum of 3 UK 
universities, or all UK universities which provide the relevant course, 
whichever is the lower number. 
 
28.38  The milkround or graduate recruitment programme does not need to be 
advertised through Find a job or Jobcentre Online in Northern Ireland, to meet 
the resident labour market test but must be advertised through 2 methods 
permitted by this guidance, one of which must be a prominent graduate 
recruitment website which does not charge a fee to jobseekers to view job 
advertisements or to apply for jobs via those advertisements. 
 
You must keep evidence to prove that no suitable settled workers were 
available to fill the vacancy. 
 
"
164,Rolling recruitment campaigns,"28.39  Rolling recruitment programmes allow companies to pick out skilled individuals 
who might fill future, undefined vacancies rather than specific ones. 
 
28.40  We understand why you may want to identify migrants through these 
programmes and we don’t want to stop this happening. However, to meet the 
Page 124 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
requirements of the resident labour market test when a specific vacancy 
becomes available, it must be advertised as set out in this guidance to give 
settled workers a chance to apply. 
"
165,Recruitment agency and head-hunters,"28.41  You can use an agency or head-hunter to help with your recruitment. They 
may recruit for the post on your behalf, but the recruitment exercise must meet 
the requirements of the resident labour market test. 
28.42  Where an agency or head-hunter carries out the recruitment exercise, you are 
fully responsible for the resident labour market test. If it is not done in line with 
the rules, we will take action against you. 
 
"
166,Internet,"28.43  You can advertise the job online. We do not restrict you to specific websites, 
but it must be one of the following: 
•  the relevant online government job-search service (Find a Job, JobCentre 
Online, or Teaching Vacancies) – this is mandatory, unless an exception 
in paragraph 28.19 above applies 
•  an online version of a national newspaper that would meet the 
requirements - see national newspapers for more information on this 
•  an online version of a professional journal that would meet the 
requirements - see professional journal for more information on this 
•  website of a prominent or professional recruitment organisation 
28.44  If you are a multi-national/global operation, or have over 250 employees in the 
UK, you can advertise the job on your own website. 
 
28.45  If you advertise the job online, the website must not charge a subscription or 
any fee to look at job advertisements or to apply for jobs via these 
advertisements.

29 Tier 2 (General) certificate of 
sponsorship  
 
Note: if you intend to assign certificates of sponsorship at RQF level 3 or above 
under the points-based immigration system that will come into force from 1 January 
2021, see Annex 9 of this guidance.  
 
Overview 
29.  When you assign a Tier 2 (General) certificate of sponsorship (CoS), you are 
confirming that either: 
•  you have carried out a resident labour market test as set out in this 
guidance and have been unable to identify a suitable settled worker to fill 
the post  
•  a resident labour market test is not required  
 
29.1  All CoS, restricted or unrestricted, must be assigned within 6 months of the 
date the vacancy was first advertised. Where the vacancy has been advertised 
in 2 stages, the CoS must be assigned within 6 months of the date the first of 
the 2 advertisements appeared.  
 
Exceptions to this 6-month limit are where: 
 
•  a migrant is recruited via a milkround, a CoS must be assigned within 48 
months of the milkround taking place, providing the migrant was offered 
the job within 12 months of that recruitment campaign ending 
•  the job falls within one of the PhD level standard occupational 
classification (SOC) codes listed in Table 1 of Appendix J to the 
Immigration Rules, a CoS must be assigned within 12 months of the start 
of the recruitment process  
•  the migrant has been recruited to a pupillage position for trainee 
barristers, a CoS must be assigned within 24 months of the pupillage 
position first being advertised 
•  the job advertised is for a rank and file (tutti) orchestral musician, the CoS 
must be assigned within 24 months of the date the job was first advertised 
 
This makes sure the results of advertising reflect the current availability of the 
skills you need. 
 
29.2  When you assign a CoS, you must: 
 
•  give full details of the resident labour market test carried out, including: 
o  the dates the job was advertised 
o  where the job was advertised 
o  any relevant job advertisement reference numbers, including the Find 
a Job, Jobcentre Online, or the GOV.UK Teaching Vacancies service 
job reference number, if applicable

169,‘Health and Care Visa’ for key health workers,"29.3  From 4 August 2020, eligible health workers who have been trained to a 
recognised standard and have good working English can apply for a ‘Health 
and Care Visa’. The benefits of the Health and Care Visa include fast-track 
entry to the UK, the support of a dedicated team within UKVI in processing 
migrants’ and their dependent families’ visa applications, reduced visa fees 
and exemption from the Immigration Health Surcharge. The Health and Care 
Visa forms part of the Tier 2 (General) category for skilled workers. 
Note: you can assign a CoS to an eligible migrant for a Health and Care Visa 
before 4 August 2020, but the migrant will not be able to apply for a Health 
and Care Visa before that date.  
 
29.4 
If you wish to sponsor a Tier 2 (General) migrant for a Health and Care Visa, 
you must read Section A of the Tier 2 Policy Guidance for detailed information 
on the eligibility criteria.  
 
29.5  Among other requirements set out in the Tier 2 Policy Guidance, only migrants 
employed in the following SOC codes are eligible for the Health and Care 
Visa: 
•  2112 – Biological scientists and biochemists 
•  2113 – Physical Scientists 
•  2211 – Medical Practitioners 
•  2212 – Psychologists 
•  2213 – Pharmacists 
•  2214 – Ophthalmic Opticians 
•  2215 – Dental practitioners 
•  2217 – Medical Radiographers

•  2231 – Nurses 
•  2232 – Midwives 
•  2442 – Social Workers 
•  3213 – Paramedics 
 
29.6 
If the migrant will not be working in one of the above SOC codes, they will not 
be eligible for the Health and Care Visa and will have to qualify under the 
standard Tier 2 (General) arrangements.

29.7  When you assign a CoS to a Tier 2 (General) migrant for a Health and Care 
Visa, you must: 
•  include in the ‘Notes’ field of the CoS a brief explanation of how the 
migrant meets the Health and Care Visa criteria 
•  if you are a private organisation which provides services commissioned by 
the NHS, provide brief information in the Notes field about the contract or 
agreement you have with NHS trusts or bodies to provide those services – 
we may ask you to submit evidence of these arrangements and you must 
do so if asked 
•  tell the migrant they are eligible for the Health and Care Visa so they can 
correctly complete their visa application form – if you fail to do so, the 
migrant’s visa application may be rejected 
•  advise the migrant that they must not apply for their Health and Care Visa

170,Nurses and midwives: start date on CoS,"29.8  When you assign a CoS to a migrant who will be sponsored in SOC code 
‘2231 Nurses’ or ‘2232 Midwives’, the start date you give on their CoS should 
be the earliest date of: 
 
•  the date they will start working for you in familiarisation training 
•  the date they will start working for you as a full NMC registered nurse or 
midwife - if they have already passed the objective-structured clinical 
examination (OSCE) and received their registration number (PIN)  
•  the date on which they will sit their OSCE 
 
If you are sponsoring a pre-registration nurse or midwife, you should also read 
the information on sponsoring non-EEA trained nurses and midwives. 
 
"
171,Unrestricted certificate of sponsorship,"29.9  These are for: 
 
•  Tier 2 (General) workers who will be paid £159,600 or more a year 
•  Tier 2 (General) workers who are already in the UK working for you and 
need to extend their leave 
•  Tier 2 (General) workers who are already in the UK working for you and 
are changing jobs and the new job is in a different standard occupational 
classification (SOC) code 
•  Tier 2 (General) workers who are already in the UK and who want to start 
work for a new sponsor 
•  individuals already in the UK under another immigration category and who 
are eligible to switch into Tier 2 (General); this doesn’t include those who 
are in the UK as the partner of a Tier 4 migrant – such people require a 
restricted CoS 
•  high value inward investment posts - where the job offer is for the migrant 
to work in support of a posting from an overseas firm to you in connection

Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with the relocation of a high value business to the UK or a significant new 
inward investment project 
•  nurses using SOC code 2231 
•  doctors using SOC code 2211 
•  migrants who will be sponsored to work in a PhD-level job listed in Table 1 
of Appendix J to the Immigration Rules 
 
When you apply for a licence, you must tell us how many Tier 2 (General) CoS 
you would like to assign in the first year of your Tier 2 licence. These are 
called unrestricted certificates because there is no limit on how many you can 
get, providing you can justify your request. 
 
You must provide evidence to support your request. 
We may ask you for further information before we take a decision. 
We will also take a number of reasons into account, including:  
•  any agents that you will use to recruit workers and whether they have 
been linked to immigration abuse in the past 
•  the purpose of your organisations business 
•  the number of workers now employed at your organisation 
•  the length of time that you have been operating 
•  your history of compliance with the Immigration Rules and sponsor 
guidance (if you have one)  
 
If we grant fewer CoS than you asked for, this may be because:  
•  you have a history of non-compliance 
•  you cannot justify your need for the number you asked for  
•  we do not consider your need to be credible based on your current 
•  you are unsure whether or when you may need to recruit any migrants in 
circumstances    
the future 
We will add your CoS allocation to your SMS account and give you 12 months 
from the beginning of your licence to assign the CoS. After that time, any 
unassigned CoS will expire.  
 
29.10  If you are a Tier 2 (General) sponsor and your CoS year is coming to an end, 
you can apply for a ‘follow-on’ allocation for the next year. SMS guide 2: 
manage your sponsorship licence has more information on this.  
 
29.11  Before assigning a Tier 2 (General) unrestricted CoS, you must make sure 
that: 
•  you have identified the right type of CoS to assign, for example, ‘Tier 4 
graduate switching into Tier 2’ 
•  the job is at the right skill level  
Page 129 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  the vacancy filling process used complies with the resident labour market 
test requirements, where required 
•  the migrant will be paid a salary package at or above the appropriate rate  
 
 
29.12  If you assign unrestricted CoS to migrants who require a restricted CoS, we 
may revoke your sponsor licence. 
"
172,Restricted certificate of sponsorship,"29.13  Each year, there are a limited number of restricted certificates of sponsorship 
(CoS) available to Tier 2 (General) A-rated sponsors each month. The annual 
limit is 20,700 and they are divided into 12 monthly allocations, as follows: 
Provisional monthly allocation 
Application period 
6 March – 5 April 
6 April – 5 May 
6 May – 5 June

The monthly total will be adjusted in line with any restricted CoS which have 
been unallocated, returned or reclaimed during the last month, in line with the 
procedures set out in paragraphs 83 to 84A of Appendix A to the Immigration 
Rules.  
 
29.14  If you need to assign a restricted CoS to a migrant, you must apply for it using 
the restricted CoS application process. We cannot guarantee your application 
will be successful. If your licence is B-rated for Tier 2 (General) or suspended, 
you are not allowed to apply for any restricted CoS. 
 
"
173,The restricted certificate of sponsorship application cycle,"29.15  The application process works to a monthly cycle. You can make an 
application at any time using your sponsorship management system (SMS) 
account. Each application we receive will be scored against a set of criteria.  
 
On the 11th day of each month we will decide how many applications made on 
or before the 5th day of the same month can be approved. We call this the 
‘allocation date’.  
 
Applications will be decided on the next working day if the 11th day of the 
month falls on either a: 
 
•  Saturday 
Page 130 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  Sunday  
•  bank holiday in England 
 
If your application is successful, your restricted certificates of sponsorship will 
appear in your SMS account on the relevant allocation date. 
 
"
174,How to apply for a restricted certificate of sponsorship,"29.16  You apply for a restricted certificate of sponsorship (CoS) using your 
sponsorship management system (SMS) account. The application can only be 
made by a level 1 user. There is no fee to apply for a restricted CoS. 
 
29.17  You should only apply for a restricted CoS if you intend to assign it no more 
than 3 months after the allocation date appropriate to your application. If your 
application is successful, the restricted CoS will be allocated to your SMS 
account, but if not assigned after 3 months it will be removed from your 
account. If a restricted CoS is removed and you still need it, you will have to 
apply again. 
 
29.18  When you apply for a restricted CoS, you must have carried out a resident 
labour market test (where applicable) that meets the requirements in this 
guidance. 
 
29.19  When you make your application, you must fill in all mandatory fields marked 
with an asterisk. If you do not, you will not be able to send your application. All 
information you give on salary payments, skill level and the resident labour 
market test must be in line with how a Tier 2 (General) unrestricted CoS is 
assigned. The ‘Tier specific duties under Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra-
Company Transfer (ICT))’ section has more information on this.  
 
29.20  We may wish to check the information you send with your application, for 
example, if we have doubts about its validity. If we need to make any checks, 
we may ask for more information or documents. You must send us any 
information or documents within 10 working days. If you do not, your 
application will be rejected. 
 
29.21  If you do send the information or documents within the time limit, but the date 
we receive them is on or after the allocation date you have applied for, or we 
are unable to make the necessary checks before the allocation date you have 
applied for, we will hold your application until the following allocation date. If 
we have been unable to carry out those checks by the following allocation 
date, your application will be rejected. 
 
"
175,Points criteria for a restricted CoS,"29.22  Applications for a restricted certificate of sponsorship (CoS) will be scored and 
prioritised based on:  
•  the “Job and recruitment” criteria set out in the table below, and  
•  the gross annual salary you pay to the migrant (see ‘Points for salary’ 
below) 
Page 131 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
29.23  No application for a restricted CoS will be granted unless it scores points for 
both “Job and recruitment” and for gross annual salary. 
 
29.24  We cannot guarantee any valid application will result in the allocation of a 
restricted CoS. For example, if your application scores 30 points for “Job and 
recruitment” but we complete checks which reveal that you have not carried 
out a resident labour market test in accordance with this guidance, we will not 
award those points and your application will be rejected. 
 
29.25  We cannot guarantee that a salary which is approved in a restricted CoS 
application will be accepted when a migrant makes a Tier 2 application. For 
example, if you apply for a restricted CoS with a salary of £20,800, but you 
later assign it to a migrant who is not exempt from the £30,000 salary 
threshold, their application will be refused. 
 
"
176,Points for job and recruitment,"29.26  The table below sets out the points that will be awarded based on the type of 
job the migrant will do and the recruitment campaign used (where relevant): 
Job and recruitment 
Shortage occupation 
Resident labour market test met via the milkround, and the 
individual being sponsored meets the post-study work 
requirements (other than they will be applying for entry 
clearance rather than leave to remain) 
 
The job is in one of the following public service occupations:  
 
•  2217 Medical radiographers  
•  2314 Secondary education teaching professionals – 
subject teachers in maths, physics, chemistry, computer 
science and Mandarin only  
•  3213 Paramedics  
 
and the job passes the resident labour market test or an 
exemption applies 
 
Job passes the resident labour market test or an exemption 
applies 
 
Points 
320 
 
30 
30 
20 
 
 
29.27  Your application can only score points for one entry in the table above. For 
example, if a job is a shortage occupation but you have carried out a resident 
labour market test, your application will score 320 points, not 340. 
"
177,Points for salary,"29.28  We will award one point for each £1,000 of gross annual salary, up to a 
Page 132 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
maximum of £160,000. We calculate the salary in accordance with the rules in 
paragraphs 79 to 79C of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules – see ‘Salary 
information on a certificate of sponsorship’ for further guidance.  
 
29.29  In your application, you must state the salary that you will pay to the migrant if 
you are allocated a restricted CoS. If you do not yet have a confirmed salary, 
you must state the minimum salary that you are willing to pay. If you are 
subsequently allocated a CoS, you can increase the salary when you come to 
assign it to a migrant (subject to the limitations stated in paragraph 29.46) but 
you cannot pay less than you stated you would in your application for a 
restricted CoS. 
 
29.30  We will not award points for salary if it is not at or above the appropriate rate 
for the job. 
 
"
178,Scoring an application: example,"29.31  Below is an example of how we might score an application: 
 
The job is in a specified public service occupation and passes the resident 
labour market test, and the salary (including permitted allowances) is £36,600. 
Your application will score 30 points for “Job and recruitment”, plus a further 
36 points for salary (provided the salary meets the appropriate rate specified 
in Appendix J to the Rules), giving 66 points in total.  
 
"
179,The monthly allocation process,"29.32  Each application received for a restricted certificate of sponsorship (CoS) will 
be scored in line with the points table above. All applications received up to 
and including the 5th of each month that are not subject to checks will be 
considered on the 11th of that month - the ‘allocation date’.  
 
An example of this is if you apply between 6 November and 5 December, your 
application will be decided on the 11 December. 
 
29.33  We will approve valid applications solely on the number of points scored, 
starting with the highest. If the number of valid applications received is more 
than the number of CoS available, those applications scoring the lowest points 
are less likely to be approved. 
 
29.34  We may reach a point where there are more applications that score the same 
amount of points than we have CoS available. Below is an example of this. 
 
Example 
We have allocated all applications scoring between 480 points and 48 points, 
and we are left with more applications that have scored 47 points than we 
have CoS left to allocate. If this happens, we cannot make a fair decision as to 
whether any of these are more urgent or worthy than others. Therefore, we will 
either approve all of them, or none of them. 
 
29.35  We will approve all applications that score the same number of points if this 
Page 133 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
means that we exceed our monthly allocation limit by 100 or fewer. 
 
Below are 2 examples which show what happens when the monthly allocation 
is exceeded. 
 
Example 1  
On 11 September, all valid applications scoring between 480 points and 48 
points have been approved. We have 150 CoS left to allocate and 250 
applicants scoring 47 points. We will award CoS to all 250 applicants as it will 
only lead to our monthly allocation being exceeded by 100. 
 
Example 2  
On 11 September, all valid applications scoring between 480 points and 48 
points have been approved. We have 150 CoS left to allocate. There are 400 
valid applications that all score 47 points. We will not allocate any CoS for any 
valid application scoring 47 points because we would exceed our monthly limit 
by more than 100. We will carry over the 150 unallocated CoS to the following 
month. 
 
29.36  The decision we make is based on the number of points your application has 
scored. Nothing else will be taken into account and there is no right of appeal. 
If your application is successful, your restricted CoS will appear in your SMS 
account on the relevant allocation date. If unsuccessful, you can apply again 
at any time. 
 
29.37  If the monthly allocation process is undersubscribed, we will carry over any 
CoS that remain unallocated to the following month. Any CoS that remain 
unallocated at the end of each year covered by the limit will not be carried 
forward to the next year’s allocation. 
 
29.38  There may be compelling circumstances where a CoS can be granted 
exceptionally, before the next allocation date. Applications will be considered 
on merit and in line with relevant policy. It is not possible to give a full list of 
circumstances that might be defined as ‘compelling’, however approvals 
should be rare. Examples might be: 
 
•  where delays caused by us resulted in a newly licensed sponsor needing 
a CoS for a migrant who is due to start work before the 11th of the next 
month 
•  a consultant surgeon has been recruited and needs to be appointed at 
once because patients need life-saving surgery before the 11th of the 
following month 
 
29.39  We will not consider any application made due to delays caused by you that 
could have been avoided. For example, where a recruitment/appointment was 
delayed because your staff were absent. 
 
29.40  If you need to apply in this circumstance, you must send your application using 
your SMS account, and email the Tier 2 Limits team asking for your 
application to be considered urgently, and explaining the reasons for this. We 
Page 134 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
may ask for documentary evidence to support your application and may visit 
you. 
 
29.41  We only consider applications where, had they been made earlier, it would 
have been granted on the last allocation date. But there is no guarantee that 
any application will be granted. Each case will be considered on its merits and 
we expect robust evidence as to why the application couldn’t have been made 
earlier. 
 
29.42  We cannot guarantee a timescale for considering urgent applications. This is 
because it may take longer if we need to visit you or ask for documentary 
evidence to support your application. If we cannot verify an application before 
the next allocation date, it will be considered for the one after, but only if we 
can verify it in time. See ‘How to apply for a restricted CoS’ for more 
information. 
 
29.43  Any application for urgent consideration that we refuse will be carried forward 
to the next allocation date for a decision. Where we do grant any applications 
for urgent consideration, we will reduce the next monthly allocation 
accordingly. 
 
"
180,Reclaimed and returned certificate of sponsorship,"29.44  If we find, after granting you a restricted certificate of sponsorship (CoS), that 
your application for that CoS was invalid for any reason, we will reclaim it from 
your sponsorship management system (SMS) account.  
 
29.45  If you decide that you no longer need a restricted CoS, you must do one of the 
following: 
 
 
•  if the CoS is part of an application for a number of identical CoS, you must 
first assign the ones you do need then email the Tier 2 Limits team to let 
us know that it can be returned 
•  if the CoS did not form part of an application for a number of identical 
CoS, you can email the Tier 2 Limits team to let us know that it can be 
returned 
29.46  You must let us know about any restricted CoS which can be returned. We 
can then make them available to other sponsors. 
 
29.47  The status of any CoS that is returned or reclaimed will be updated in your 
SMS account. It will display as ‘returned’ or ‘reclaimed’. 
 
"
181,Use of restricted certificate of sponsorship,"29.48  If your application for a restricted certificate of sponsorship (CoS) is 
successful, you will have 3 months to assign it to a migrant. If you do not 
assign it after 3 months, it will be removed from your account. 
 
29.49  If you have any restricted CoS in your SMS account which are less than 3 
months old, and which you have not yet assigned, and you are downgraded to 
Page 135 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
a B rating for Tier 2 (General) or your licence is suspended, you will not be 
able to assign them and they will still be removed from your account after 3 
months. 
 
29.50  You can only assign a restricted CoS to fill the restricted job that you 
described on your application. When you apply for a restricted CoS, the 
information you give in your application, such as the salary and job 
description, will appear on the CoS that is allocated to you if your application is 
successful. When you assign that CoS, you will not be able to change any of 
these pre-populated fields. 
 
29.51  We accept that there may occasionally be circumstances in which some of the 
details you enter on a successful restricted CoS application may have 
changed by the time the CoS is allocated to you, or you come to assign it. 
Although you cannot amend the pre-populated fields when assigning the CoS, 
you can add a sponsor note to let us know of the following changes: 
•  salary increase (where the salary package that you will pay to the 
migrant is higher than the amount you stated on the application) – unless 
a transitional provision following updates to the appropriate rate applies, 
this is only permitted if the higher rate is still within the salary range quoted 
in the job advertisement; see ‘Advertising and salary rate’ for further 
information 
•  start and end date – you can amend either or both of these dates, but 
you should remember that a restricted CoS must be assigned within 3 
months of it being allocated to your SMS account  
 
Once the CoS has been assigned, the migrant then has only 3 months to use 
it to support an application for leave. 
 
29.52  If you do amend the salary rate using a sponsor note, you must also state, 
when adding that sponsor note, the salary range that was advertised. 
 
29.53  These are the only changes you can make to a restricted CoS when you 
assign it. If anything else has changed, such as a reduction in salary or a 
change to the standard occupation classification (SOC) code or job 
description, you must return the restricted CoS to us. You must carry out a 
new resident labour market test where required and apply again at a later date 
if necessary. 
 
29.54  You must only assign a restricted CoS to a migrant who needs one. You 
should not assign a restricted CoS to a migrant who is eligible to be assigned 
an unrestricted CoS. 
 
29.55  You must only assign a restricted CoS if you intend to employ the migrant on 
the conditions stated on the application you made for it, or in any sponsor note 
added in the circumstances permitted above. If we subsequently find that you 
gave false information on your application for a restricted CoS, we will revoke 
your sponsor licence. Examples include, but are not limited to: 
 
Page 136 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
•  the salary you pay to a migrant whose application for leave was supported 
by a restricted CoS is lower than the salary stated on your application for 
that CoS  
•  you said you had carried out a resident labour market test that met the 
requirements of this guidance, but you had failed to do so

30 Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) 
The Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer (ICT)) is for migrants who have been 
working for multinational organisations and who are being transferred by an 
overseas employer to a related UK employer. There are 2 subcategories of 
this category: 
 
•  Long-term Staff 
•  Graduate Trainee 
 
30.1  Where we refer to ‘employees’ who may be ‘working for’ you, in the context of 
the intra-company transfer arrangements, this also includes partners where 
you are, for example, a Limited Liability Partnership. 
 
30.2  This route cannot be used to transfer a migrant who is employed by an 
organisation which is not linked by common ownership or control, but who has 
been contracted by their own employer to work for one of the overseas linked 
entities. Below is an example of this. 
 
Example 
Company A overseas and Company B in the UK is linked by common 
ownership or control. The migrant is employed by Company C overseas, 
which is not linked by common ownership or control to Company A or 
Company B, but they have been contracted by Company C to work at 
Company A. This migrant cannot move to Company B under the Tier 2 (ICT) 
category. 
 
30.3  Because of the nature of transfers, you do not need to carry out a resident 
labour market test. But there are requirements unique to each subcategory 
which must be met, and migrants must be paid at least the appropriate salary 
rate permitted for the subcategory under which they will apply for leave. 
 
30.4  Under the ICT subcategories, the job the migrant will do must meet the rules 
on the skill level and appropriate salary rates as set out in this guidance. The 
‘Skill level for jobs under Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer)’ 
and ‘Rates of pay’ sections have more information. 
 
Long-term Staff 
30.5  This subcategory is for employees to be transferred to the UK to fill a post 
which cannot be filled by a settled worker. Migrants must meet one of the 
following: 
 
•  will be paid an annual salary of £73,900 or more for the job 
•  have been working for your organisation for at least 12 months, either: 
o  outside the UK for a business established outside the territory of the 
UK which is linked by common ownership or control to you 
o  inside the UK, as long as they had permission to work for you as a 
Tier 2 (ICT) Long-term Staff or Short-term Staff migrant

182,Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer),
183,Long-term Staff,"30.5  This subcategory is for employees to be transferred to the UK to fill a post 
which cannot be filled by a settled worker. Migrants must meet one of the 
following: 
 
•  will be paid an annual salary of £73,900 or more for the job 
•  have been working for your organisation for at least 12 months, either: 
o  outside the UK for a business established outside the territory of the 
UK which is linked by common ownership or control to you 
o  inside the UK, as long as they had permission to work for you as a

o  as a Representative of an Overseas Business where you are the 
business established by the migrant while they had leave in that 
capacity 
o  any combination of the above 
30.6  The 12-month period above must be one of the following: 
•  a continuous period of 12 months immediately prior to the date of their 
application for leave 
•  an aggregated period of at least 12 months overseas within any 
timeframe, provided the migrant has been working continuously and 
lawfully for your organisation, either overseas or in the UK, since the start 
of that aggregated 12-month period – for example:  
o  the migrant worked for you overseas for 6 months, then worked for 
you for 2 years in the UK as the dependant of another migrant, before 
working for you overseas for a further 6 months - you can add the two 
6-month overseas periods together to make the required 12 months 
•  an aggregated period of at least 12 months within a 24-month period 
immediately prior to the date of their application for leave if, within the 12 
months immediately prior to their application, they have been absent from 
work for any of the following reasons (or the equivalent type of absence or 
leave in the country or territory where the migrant was working for the 
linked overseas business): 
o  statutory maternity leave 
o  statutory paternity leave 
o  statutory parental leave 
o  statutory shared parental leave 
o  statutory adoption leave 
o  sick leave 
o  assisting in a national or international humanitarian or environmental 
o  taking part in strike action as part of a legally-organised industrial 
crisis overseas 
action 
30.7  A migrant can have leave granted under the Long-term Staff subcategory for 
any period of time up to a maximum of 5 years in total. If the migrant is a high 
earner (salary of £120,000 or more), they can extend their stay up to a 
maximum of 9 years. 
 
30.8  Where a migrant leaves the UK after a period of Tier 2 leave granted under 
the Long-term Staff subcategory, but you want them to return to the UK in 
future, they may be affected by the cooling-off period.  
 
"
184,Graduate Trainee,"30.9  This subcategory of Tier 2 (ICT) can be used to transfer recent graduate 
recruits to the UK for training for any period up to a maximum of 12 months.  
This route must not be used to fill long term posts. A migrant in the Tier 2 (ICT) 
structured graduate training programme with progression towards a 
managerial or specialist role within the organisation. 
Page 139 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
30.10  You must not use this route to transfer all of your graduate recruits. It is only 
for those on accelerated promotion schemes. 
 
30.11  The migrant must have been employed outside of the UK by you for a 
minimum of 3 months before coming to the UK. Time spent in the UK under 
the previous Tier 2 (ICT) Skills Transfer subcategory (now removed) does not 
count towards the 3-month qualifying period for the Tier 2 (ICT) Graduate 
Trainee subcategory. 
 
30.12  This subcategory is specifically targeted at the best graduate recruits and you 
are limited to transferring no more than 20 migrants per financial year under 
this subcategory. If you transfer more than 20 graduate trainees, we will take 
action against you. 
 
30.13  Where a migrant leaves the UK after a period of leave in the Tier 2 (ICT) 
future, they may be affected by the cooling-off period if they return under any 
Tier 2 category other than the Tier 2 (ICT) Long-term Staff subcategory. 
 
"
185,Evidence for migrant applications for leave,"30.14  Migrants applying in the Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) category may have to 
give us evidence to prove that they have been working for you or the linked 
overseas business for the required period. The evidence may include payslips, 
bank or building society statements or building society pass books, and 
evidence of any absences referred to in paragraph 30.6 above. The evidence 
that may be required is specified in paragraph 74C-SD of Appendix A to the 
Immigration Rules.  
 
"
186,Salary and allowances,"30.15  Migrants in both of the Tier 2 (ICT) subcategories must be paid at the 
appropriate rate. The ‘Rates of pay’ section has more information on this. The 
salary may be paid in the UK or abroad. Where the migrant will be paid abroad 
in a currency other than pounds sterling, the salary entered on the certificate 
of sponsorship (CoS) must be based on the exchange rate for the relevant 
currency on the day the CoS is assigned, taken from the rates published on 
‘OANDA’. We take account of: 
 
•  basic pay excluding overtime 
•  allowances and guaranteed bonuses - allowances can include payments 
to cover extra costs of living whilst in the UK but cannot include: 
o  benefits such as overtime, bonus or incentive pay which is not 
guaranteed 
o  employer pension contributions 
o  allowances to cover business expenses including travel between the 
source country and the UK 
o  the value of any shares which the migrant receives when offered a job 
under an employee shareholder employment contract 
Page 140 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  accommodation allowances, but only up to a maximum of 30% of the total 
gross salary package - this is whether allowances are made available in 
cash or kind; the migrant’s salary and other (non-accommodation) 
allowances must be at least 70% of the maximum package that we take 
into account. This applies only to applications supported by a CoS 
assigned under the Tier 2 (ICT) Long-term Staff subcategory 
 
Below are 2 examples of how Long-term Staff allowances are worked out. 
Example 1 
You assign a CoS under the Long-term Staff subcategory. The CoS details the 
following figures: 
•  salary and other (non-accommodation) allowances total £42,000 
•  accommodation allowances total £14,000 
Add these 2 figures together to get the total package offered = £56,000. 
We work out the maximum package we can take into account by dividing the 
salary and other (non-accommodation) allowances by 70% (0.7) 
£42,000 ÷ 0.7 = £60,000. 
The total offered is less than the maximum package we can take into account. 
We will therefore take the entire package into account. 
 
Example 2 
You assign a CoS under the Long-term Staff subcategory. The CoS details the 
following figures: 
 
•  salary and other (non-accommodation) allowances total £24,500 
•  accommodation allowances total £21,000 
 
Add these 2 figures together to get the total package offered = £45,500. 
 
We work out the maximum package we can take into account by dividing the 
salary and other (non-accommodation) allowances by 70% (0.7) 
£24,500 ÷ 0.7 = £35,000. 
 
The total offered is more than the maximum package we can take into 
account. We will therefore only take into account £35,000 which is below the 
minimum acceptable rate for the Tier 2 (ICT) Long-term Staff subcategory so 
the application will be refused. 
 
30.16  Due to higher costs for short term accommodation, where an application is 
supported by a CoS assigned under the Tier 2 (ICT) Graduate Trainee 
subcategory, we take account of accommodation allowances up to 40% of the 
gross salary. This means the migrant’s salary and other (non-accommodation) 
allowances must be at least 60% of the maximum package that we will take 
into account. This applies where either: 
 
Page 141 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
•  the migrant is applying from outside the UK with a CoS that has been 
•  the migrant is applying for an extension that will take their total stay in the 
assigned for 12 months or less 
UK to 12 months or less 
 
Below is an example of how the Tier 2 (ICT) Graduate Trainee allowances are 
worked out. 
 
Example 
You assign a CoS under the Tier 2 (ICT) Graduate Trainee subcategory. The 
CoS details the following figures: 
 
•  salary and other (non-accommodation) allowances total £18,000 
•  accommodation allowances total £10,000 
 
Add these 2 figures together to get the total package offered = £28,000.  
 
We work out the maximum package we can take into account by dividing the 
salary and other (non-accommodation) allowances by 60% (0.6), instead of 
70% £18,000 ÷ 0.6 = £30,000.  
 
The total package offered is less than the maximum package we can take into 
account. We will therefore take the entire package into account.

31 Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) 
 
31. 
This category is for those coming to fill vacancies as religious workers in bona 
fide religious organisations. The only exception applies to the Ministry of 
Defence who can apply to be a sponsor under this category provided they will 
be employing religious personnel. 
 
31.1  The Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) category includes anyone doing preaching 
and pastoral work.  
Pastoral duties include: 
•  leading worship regularly and on special occasions 
•  providing religious education for children and adults by preaching or 
•  leading at marriages, funerals and other special services 
•  offering counselling and welfare support to members of the organisation 
•  recruiting, training and co-ordinating work of local volunteers and lay 
teaching 
preachers 
 
31.2  Migrants sponsored under this category may undertake a wider range of other 
duties as well as the above. 
 
31.3  This category is also for migrants coming to the UK as missionaries or as 
members of religious orders, for example, a monastic community of monks or 
nuns, or a similar religious community involving a permanent commitment. 
 
31.4  The duties of a missionary need not be restricted to preaching and teaching 
and may include the organisation of missionary activity, but should not be 
mainly administrative or clerical, unless filling a senior post. A senior post may 
be one which does not involve the migrant doing fieldwork themselves, but 
where they will be supervising staff and/or co-ordinating the organisation of 
missionary work. They may also be in charge of activity such as accounts, 
finance, personnel management or IT. Working full-time as a teacher in a 
school run by a church or missionary organisation does not count as 
missionary work, but translating religious texts does. 
 
31.5  The work of a member of a religious order must be within the order itself, or 
outside work directed by the order. Teachers working in schools not 
maintained by their order must be sponsored under Tier 2 (General). Novices 
whose training is taking part in the daily community life of their order can be 
sponsored under this category, but anyone studying for a qualification on a 
formal full-time course or training in an academic institution not maintained by 
the order should be sponsored under Tier 4. People who are not members of a 
religious order, but who are working or studying within such a community are 
not allowed to apply under this category. They must be sponsored under the 
relevant work or study category if they can meet all of the requirements.

187,Tier 2 (Minister of Religion),
188,Resident labour market test for Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) and Tier 5 (Temporary,
189,When a resident labour market test is not required,"31.9  A resident labour market test is not required where the: 
 
 
•  role is supernumerary; this means it is over and above normal 
requirements and if the person filling the role was not there, it wouldn’t be 
filled by anyone else - one example might be where the migrant offers 
pastoral support to members of a church community as part of their own 
development, but the work would stop if they were not there and you 
wouldn’t replace them 
•  migrant will mainly live within and be a member of a religious order  - for 
example, an order of nuns or monks; a religious order is defined for our 
purposes as a lineage of communities or of people who live in some way 
set apart from society in accordance with their specific religious devotion, 
and which must be part of a bona fide religious organisation - see the ‘Tier 
2 (Minister of Religion)’ section for more information on this 
31.10  A position that is not supernumerary is one vital to your requirements. 
Examples might include, but are not limited to: 
 
•  a pastor or clergyman responsible for leading regular worship or for the 
pastoral needs of their own, or the wider community - if that person left, 
but those duties still existed and you had to find someone to replace them, 
the role is not supernumerary 
Page 144 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  a teacher in a school or college maintained by a religious organisation - if 
that person left, but classes they taught had to continue, the role is not 
supernumerary 
31.11  You must justify that a role is supernumerary. When assigning a CoS for a 
supernumerary role, you must fully explain in the ‘Details of labour market test’ 
box (Tier 2) or by adding a sponsor note (Tier 5), why the role is 
supernumerary. Stating ‘the role is supernumerary’ is not enough, you must 
explain why. Also, if the migrant mainly lives within a religious order, you must 
say this to justify why a resident labour market test is not applicable. If there is 
no explanation or we are not sure about any explanation you have given, we 
may ask you for more information and it is possible that the migrant’s 
application for leave may be refused. 
 
Advertising the role to meet the resident labour market test 
requirements 
31.12  Where a role is not supernumerary or does not involve living within and being 
a member of a religious order, a national recruitment search must always be 
undertaken. We call this a resident labour market test. You must carry out a 
resident labour market test to make sure that you are not denying or displacing 
a settled worker by filling the role with a migrant. 
 
31.13  The role must be advertised for a minimum of 28 days in a national media 
appropriate to your religion or denomination, for example, a magazine, or 
newspaper such as the Church Times, The Catholic Herald, The Jewish 
Chronicle. Any publication must be available throughout the UK, or throughout 
whichever part of the UK the role is situated. For example, for a role in 
Glasgow, the publication used must be available throughout Scotland. Media 
only available in a local area is not acceptable, for example, a local or county-
wide evening newspaper. 
 
31.14  If there is no suitable national form of media for your religion, you can 
advertise online either through the Find a job service (or, in Northern Ireland, 
JobCentre Online), or the employment section of a national newspaper. A 
national newspaper is one published at least once a week and is marketed 
throughout the UK or throughout the devolved nation in which the job is 
located. This could be The Scotsman and The Herald, which are acceptable 
for jobs in Scotland; The Western Mail for jobs in Wales; and the Belfast 
Telegraph for jobs in Northern Ireland. 
 
31.15  You can also advertise on your own website if this is how you usually reach 
out to your community on a national scale and this is where you normally 
advertise vacant positions. If you do advertise on your own website, the pages 
containing the advertisement must be free to view. If your website requires 
people to pay a fee or make a donation to be able to view an advertisement for 
a vacant role, this does not meet our requirements, so you must also advertise 
in some other form of national media as described in this section. 
 
31.16  Where the role is not advertised, you can still meet the requirements of the

period of the loan. If your player is moving on loan, you must report this to us 
using your sponsorship management system (SMS) account within 10 working 
days of the move. 
32.11  During the loan period, you continue to be responsible for the player and must 
make arrangements with the loan club so that you can continue to meet your 
duties. The loan club does not need to make an application for a governing 
body endorsement, nor have a sponsor licence. When the player returns from 
loan, you must report this to us using your SMS account within 10 working 
days. 
 
32.12  If your player is permanently transferred to another UK club, you must tell us 
using your SMS account and the new club must make an application for a

player must have been granted leave to play for their new club before they 
play for them.

It allows young people, aged between 18 and 30, to travel to the UK for mainly 
noneconomic reasons, and offers young migrants from participating countries 
and territories, opportunities to work temporarily while experiencing life in the 
UK. 
 
33.3  Sponsors under the Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) are the national

33.4  Sponsored young people from participating countries and territories are 
allowed to come to the UK for up to 2 years. Young UK nationals enjoy similar

work in the UK, except professional sport, or work as a doctor in training 
unless they obtained their medical qualification in the UK. Restrictions also 
apply for individuals who want to set up their own business. They can also 
study but this should not be the main purpose of their visit.

Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) 
33.2  The Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) category is a cultural exchange scheme 
which aims to promote the UK overseas and to encourage trade and tourism. 
It allows young people, aged between 18 and 30, to travel to the UK for mainly

Further information on the scheme and the requirements migrants must meet 
are in the ‘Tier 5 (Youth Mobility Scheme) Guidance’ on GOV.UK. 
 
33.5  The Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) category offers migrants a range of ways to 
come to the UK, to work in a variety of temporary roles. 
 
33.6  We recognise that under Tier 5 the sponsor may not always be the employer. 
In some circumstances, a migrant may meet all of the Tier 5 criteria where 
there is no direct employer/employee relationship. Even though an 
employer/employee relationship may not exist, there must be a sponsor who is 
able and willing to take responsibility for them and meet all of the duties 
associated with being their sponsor. If you are taking on this role, you will be 
responsible for the migrants you sponsor, even if you are not their employer. 
Below are 3 examples of where the sponsor is not the direct employer. 
Page 150 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 1 
In parts of the arts and entertainments sector, a migrant may be employed 
through an entity such as a Special Purpose Vehicle - if this is the case, we 
expect the sponsor to be a producer, co-producer or general management 
company even though they do not directly employ the migrant. 
Example 2 
Where a musical group or theatre troupe, and their support entourage, is on 
tour in the UK temporarily, they will not usually be employees of the sponsor. 
Example 3 
There will be occasions within the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Government 
Authorised Exchange subcategory where an overarching sponsor must 
administer schemes but cannot be the direct employer of any migrants it 
sponsors to participate in its scheme. 
33.7  Where a migrant is not your direct employee, we will look closely at your 
arrangements and monitor you to make sure that you are fulfilling your 
sponsor duties. We will take action against you if you are not fulfilling all your 
sponsorship duties. 
33.8  When you assign a CoS to a migrant under any subcategory of Tier 5, the 
gross salary figure on the CoS must represent what you will ensure the 
migrant is paid, gross of any tax paid whether paid in the UK or overseas, and 
must include any permissible allowances and guaranteed bonuses. The total 
of all allowances and guaranteed bonuses paid, and included in that figure, 
should be entered in the ‘gross allowances’ box on the CoS, then broken down 
and detailed in the free text box that follows. 
Codes of practice: standard occupational classification 
codes 
33.9  When you assign a CoS, you must choose the standard occupational 
classification (SOC) code which contains the job description that best matches 
the role you want to recruit for. Appendix J to the Immigration Rules contains 
information about each SOC code and sample job titles and duties that fit 
within each code. You should be able to find the correct SOC code by 
searching Appendix J for job titles or key words. 
 
You may find that if you search for job titles, the SOC code containing that job 
title does not match the duties that the migrant will perform. This is because 
different employers use the same job title to describe different jobs or use 
generic job titles that cover several different jobs. If this happens, you should 
search further, for example, using key words, for a job description that 
matches the migrant’s duties.

203,Where the migrant will work within the sporting sector,"34.14  The sporting provisions of Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) are for sportspeople 
(and their entourage where appropriate) who are internationally established at 
the highest level in their sport and/or their employment will make a significant 
contribution to the development and operation of that sport in the UK. Coaches 
must be suitably qualified to undertake the role in question. 
 
All CoS assigned to migrants in the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Creative and 
Sporting category as a sportsperson must be sponsored in either of the 
following SOC codes: 
 
•  3441 – Sports players 
•  3442 – Sports coaches, instructors and officials 
 
These SOC codes should not be used for CoS assigned in any other Tier 5 
category. 
 
34.15  All migrants in this category must be endorsed by the appropriate sports 
governing body. This confirms that they meet the governing body 
endorsement requirements as agreed between us and them and confirms that 
as a player or coach they: 
 
•  are internationally established at the highest level and/or 
•  will make a significant contribution to the development of their sport in the 
UK 
 
34.16  When you assign a CoS to a sports person under the sporting provisions of 
Tier 5, you must enter their governing body endorsement reference number in 
the relevant box on the CoS. You must ensure that the sports person has an 
electronic copy of their endorsement to print out and provide with their visa 
application. 
 
34.17  A migrant who has already been granted leave under Tier 5 for a job as a 
footballer, may change (‘switch’) into Tier 2 (Sportsperson) if they will still be 
employed as a footballer and can meet the Tier 2 (Sportsperson) migrant 
requirements. 
 
34.18  When you assign a CoS in the creative or sporting sector, you are 
guaranteeing that the migrant: 
 
•  is seeking entry to the UK to work or perform in the relevant sector 
•  is not intending to establish a business in the UK 
•  poses no threat to the resident labour market 
Page 155 of 209

•  will comply with the conditions (rules) of their permission to stay and, 
where they have been granted leave under Tier 5, will leave the UK when 
it expires 
 
"
204,Tier 5 Creative and Sporting visa concession,"34.19  Migrants sponsored under the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) category must 
normally have been granted entry clearance (a visa) before coming to the UK. 
The only exception is for non-visa nationals in the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) 
Creative and Sporting subcategory who are seeking entry for no more than 3 
months under paragraph 245ZN(b) in Part 6A of the Immigration Rules. 
34.20  A ‘non-visa national’ means someone who is not a national of a country or 
territory specified in Appendix 2 to Appendix V of the Immigration Rules 
(whose nationals always require visas to come to the UK). This concession 
does not apply to visa nationals. 
34.21  There are arrangements at the UK border to allow non-visa nationals to gain 
entry to the UK under this concession. They must present their CoS number to 
the immigration officer, and any evidence for the points they are claiming. We 
recommend you make sure that when assigning a CoS, migrants understand 
these arrangements and that leave to enter may take a little longer to process 
due to the checks that Border Force staff must carry out. We recommend that 
your sponsored migrants have your contact details in case they need to 
contact you. 
34.22  If you are sponsoring a non-visa national to come to the UK under this 
concession, you need to be aware that, on entry to the UK, they will be subject 
to the general grounds for refusal in Part 9 (paragraphs 320 and 321A) of the 
Immigration Rules. This means that even if they might otherwise qualify for 
entry, there may be other reasons, such as their previous conduct, that may 
lead to the application being refused. Non-visa nationals may apply for entry 
clearance in advance of travel if there is any concern their entry will be 
delayed or prevented.  
"
205,Use of ePassport gates,"34.23  Since 20 May 2019, nationals of seven countries (Australia, Canada, Japan, 
New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States) have been able 
to use ePassport gates (‘eGates’) to enter the UK if they are coming as visitors 
or hold a valid UK entry clearance (visa) prior to their arrival.  
 
34.24  However, those coming to the UK under the Tier 5 creative and sporting visa 
concession are not able to benefit from this change. This is because an 
individual who enters the UK through an eGate will not have their CoS 
activated and will not be granted the right type of leave to enter to allow them 
to work.  
34.25  You must therefore advise individuals whom you are sponsoring under this 
concession that they must see an immigration officer at a manned desk and 
that they must not seek to enter the UK through an eGate. If they mistakenly 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 156 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
use an eGate, they will need to leave the Common Travel Area and re-enter 
the UK, making sure that they see an immigration officer, in order to have their 
CoS activated and obtain the correct form of leave.  
 
Note: the Common Travel Area is the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the 
Channel Islands (Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey). 
 
 
 
 
"
206,Entry through Ireland,"34.26  If a non-visa national who would otherwise qualify under this concession will 
be entering the UK via Ireland, they must either apply to be granted leave to 
enter remotely (using the remote clearance process) or obtain a UK visa in 
advance of their arrival in the UK. This is because individuals travelling from 
Ireland to the UK will not necessarily encounter an immigration officer to 
endorse the correct form of leave to permit entry under this concession. 
Further information can be found in the Common Travel Area guidance on 
GOV.UK.  
34.27  The option to request leave to enter remotely is only available if the migrant 
will enter Ireland from outside the Common Travel Area (CTA) and then 
proceed directly to the UK. They must apply (or you, as their sponsor, must 
apply on their behalf) for remote clearance at least 72 hours before they enter 
the UK. If they enter the UK before they have been granted remote clearance, 
they will not have permission to work and must leave the CTA. They will then 
need to seek readmission to the UK, making sure that they either:  
•  see an immigration officer on arrival (if re-entering the UK from outside the 
CTA), or  
•  apply for remote clearance at least 72 hours before arriving in the UK (if 
they will re-enter Ireland from outside the CTA before returning to the UK)  
34.28  The option to request leave to enter remotely is not available if the individual 
will commence a contract of employment which, because of the nature of that 
employment, would require their employer to undertake right to work checks. 
This is because remote clearance would not provide the employer with a 
‘statutory excuse’ under illegal working legislation. In such cases, the migrant 
must obtain a UK visa before entering through Ireland. For further information 
on preventing illegal working, see ‘Right to work checks: an employer's guide’ 
on GOV.UK. 
"
207,Leaving and returning to the UK under this concession,"34.29  Where a non-visa national is granted leave to enter under this concession, 
their leave will lapse (end) as soon as they leave the Common Travel Area. 
This means that they will not automatically be able to re-enter the UK on the 
basis of their original leave.  
 
34.30  We understand that the migrant may need to come back to the UK to fulfil their 
engagements. In these circumstances, the migrant must give an immigration 
officer their original CoS number again on arrival at the UK border. An 
immigration officer will ask the migrant to give evidence of meeting the

Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
maintenance requirements again. They will carry out checks to make sure that 
you have not withdrawn your sponsorship since the migrant’s original entry. 
We may speak to you again to confirm the details on the CoS. If the migrant 
meets all the criteria, we will be able to grant leave to allow them to finish the 
engagements for their sponsor within the period of their original grant of leave.

35 Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Charity 
Worker 
 
35.  Migrants coming to work temporarily in the UK as charity workers must only be 
doing voluntary fieldwork directly related to the purpose of your charity. You 
cannot offer paid employment under this category. ‘Voluntary fieldwork’ means 
activities which would not normally be offered at a waged or salaried rate and 
which contribute directly to the achievement or advancement of the sponsor’s 
charitable purpose. It does not include work ancillary to the sponsor’s 
charitable purpose including, for example, routine back office administrative 
roles, retail or other sales roles, fund-raising roles and roles involved in the 
maintenance of the sponsor’s offices and other assets. 
 
35.1  When you assign a certificate of sponsorship (CoS) under the Tier 5 
(Temporary Worker) Charity Worker category, you are guaranteeing that the 
migrant: 
 
•  intends to undertake voluntary fieldwork related to the purpose of your 
charity for up to 12 months 
•  will not be paid or receive other remuneration for their work (with the 
exception of reasonable expenses outlined in section 44 of the National 
Minimum Wage Act 1988 (as amended from time to time)  
•  will not be filling a permanent position - this includes temporarily 
undertaking a position which is permanently required 
•  will comply with the conditions (rules) of their permission to stay and, 
where granted leave under Tier 5, will leave the UK when it expires 
 
35.2  Migrants entering the UK under the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Charity Worker 
category will be given a maximum of 12 months’ permission to stay. Their 
dependants are allowed to work if they are with or joining them in the UK.

The exceptions are where contractual service suppliers will provide one of the 
following: 
 
•  advertising and translation services - they must have relevant

Sponsoring contractual service suppliers and independent 
professionals 
39.16  When you assign a CoS, you are guaranteeing that: 
•  the migrant is employed by a business or is self-employed on the territory 
of a country outside the UK that is party to an eligible trade agreement – 
see Appendix F of the guidance for sponsors for a list of eligible 
agreements 
•  will be engaged in work that is covered by the UK’s commitments under 
•  will comply with the conditions (rules) of their permission to stay and will 
one of those agreements

39.17  If you want to bring contractual service suppliers or independent professionals 
to the UK under a new contract, you must tell us about this and not assign any 
CoS in connection with this until we have agreed it meets the requirements set 
out in this guidance. You can use your SMS account ‘Request change of 
circumstances function’ to tell us about any new contract. Once reported, we 
will ask you for supporting evidence and you must send us any documents or 
information within the time limit set. 
 
39.18  We will revoke your sponsor licence if you assign a CoS in connection with a 
contract that: 
 
•  you have not told us about 
•  you have told us about, but we have not yet confirmed that you can assign 
a CoS for that contract 
•  we have told you does not meet the requirements set out in this guidance 
Important notes about assigning a certificate of 
sponsorship to a contractual service supplier or 
independent professional 
39.19  When assigning a certificate of sponsorship (CoS) you will come to a box that 
asks you to tell us how much the migrant will be paid. This is mandatory and 
you must enter a figure. We know that you will not be paying a salary to the 
migrant, so you can enter a nominal figure, for example, £0.01. 
 
39.20  You must also say in the ‘Summary of job description’ box that the CoS is for 
either a ‘contractual service supplier’ or an ‘independent professional’ by 
entering one of those phrases. If you forget before you assign the CoS, you 
can retrieve it from within your SMS account and add a ‘Sponsor note’ that 
says ‘Contractual service supplier’ or Independent professional’. Once 
assigned, you can add a ‘Sponsor note’ at any time before the migrant uses it

219,Migrants’ initial permission to stay,"40.  Migrants applying under the Tier 2 and Tier 5 categories cannot apply for initial 
leave more than 3 months in advance of their employment start date, as stated 
on their certificate of sponsorship (CoS). You must make sure the timing of 
your recruitment and the date you assign the CoS does not put the migrant in 
a situation where they cannot make a successful application for leave to enter 
or remain in the UK. 
 
"
220,The cooling-off period,"40.1 
If a migrant has been sponsored in any Tier 2 category, or in the Religious 
Workers subcategory or Charity Workers subcategory of Tier 5 (Temporary 
Worker), and their leave has ended or expired, they must wait 12 months 
before applying again in the relevant category. We call this the ‘cooling-off 
period’. 
 
40.2  The cooling-off period applies where: 
•  the migrant has, in the 12 months immediately preceding the current 
application, had entry clearance or leave to remain in a category referred 
to in paragraph 40.1 (‘relevant category’), and that leave has since expired 
•  in the case of a Tier 2 migrant, the CoS which led to that grant of leave 
was issued for more than 3 months, and 
•  the migrant is either: 
o  applying for entry clearance from outside the UK, or 
o  in the UK and had a previous period of Tier 2 leave, but then changed 
(‘switched’) into a different immigration category and now wishes to 
apply again under Tier 2 
40.3  While the cooling-off period applies: 
•  a migrant who was previously sponsored in any Tier 2 category cannot be 
granted any further entry clearance in any Tier 2 category, or apply to 
switch into Tier 2 (General), Tier 2 (Minister of Religion), or Tier 2 
(Sportsperson) 
•  a migrant who was previously sponsored in either the Charity Workers 
subcategory or Religious Workers subcategory of Tier 5 (Temporary 
Worker) cannot be granted any further entry clearance in either of those 
subcategories 
 
40.4 
If you want to sponsor a migrant under any category of Tier 2, or in the Charity 
Worker or Religious Worker subcategory of Tier 5, they should be able to tell 
you if they have had a period of leave in one of those categories, so that you 
can check if they are allowed to make a further application. 
 
40.5  The cooling-off period starts the day after the migrant’s last leave in the 
relevant category has ended or expired. 
Page 173 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
 
 
40.6 
 
If the migrant’s previous grant of leave was curtailed for any reason, the 
cooling-off period starts from the day after their curtailed period of leave 
expired. 
 
40.7  Where the migrant left the UK before their last period of leave in a relevant 
category expired, the cooling-off period can start earlier than the date their 
leave expired, but only if they can give us evidence of them having not been in 
the UK with leave in a relevant category for a period before that date.  
 
Evidence may include, but is not limited to: 
 
•  travel tickets or boarding card stubs, but only if you, or the migrant’s last 
sponsor also sent an SMS report at the time, confirming their employment 
in the UK had ended 
•  exit or entry stamps in the migrant’s passport confirming they were not in 
the UK 
•  a letter from the migrant’s overseas employer confirming the date they 
started work overseas, after returning from the UK 
•  other evidence that shows the migrant was not in the UK 
 
Where evidence is produced and accepted, we work out the cooling-off period 
to start from the earliest date supported by evidence. 
 
"
221,Additional exceptions under Tier 2,"40.8  The Tier 2 cooling-off period does not apply where the migrant: 
 
•  is in the UK and applying for an extension to their existing leave  
•  is in the UK and is making a change of employment application 
•  is applying as a high earner – someone whose gross salary package 
accepted for a Tier 2 (General) application is £159,600 or higher, or 
£120,000 or higher for a Tier 2 (ICT) application 
•  is applying under the Tier 2 (ICT) Long-term Staff subcategory and their 
last grant of Tier 2 leave was in one of the following intra-company 
transfer categories: 
o  Skills Transfer 
o  Graduate Trainee 
o  Short-term Staff 
•  was only in the UK as a Tier 2 migrant during the last 12 months for a short 
period(s) with a CoS which was assigned for 3 months or less. This could 
be where a migrant:  
o  was assigned a CoS of 3 months or less in the preceding 12-month 
period, and had no other Tier 2 leave during that period, the cooling-
off period will not apply 
o  has had more than one period of Tier 2 leave in the last 12 months 
and each CoS was assigned for less than 3 months, even where they 
may total over 3 months, the cooling-off period will not apply 
Note: it is the intention that this waiver permits only short-term 
periods of leave in the UK. If you intend to sponsor a migrant in the 
Page 174 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
UK for longer than 3 months, you should assign the CoS under the 
appropriate subcategory 
o  was assigned a CoS of 6 months in length but you notified us that they 
finished working for you in the UK after 2 months, the cooling-off 
period will apply (as the CoS was assigned for more than 3 months) 
"
222,Maintenance (available funds),"40.9  Migrants in all tiers must show that they have enough money to support 
themselves and any dependants when they enter the UK, until they start to 
receive an income. The ‘Guidance for dependants of UK visa applicants (Tiers 
1, 2, 4, 5) on GOV.UK has more information on this. 
 
40.10  To qualify for entry clearance, or leave to remain in the UK under the Tier 2 or 
Tier 5 categories, the migrant must meet the maintenance requirements set 
out in the Tier 2 and Tier 5 guidance for migrants and Appendix C to the 
Immigration Rules.  
 
40.11  If your licence is rated A, A (Premium) or A (SME+), you can certify 
maintenance for any migrant sponsored under the Tier 2 or Tier 5 categories. 
You can also certify maintenance for dependants of any Tier 2 or Tier 5 
migrants. 
 
40.12  If you want to certify maintenance for a migrant and their dependants under 
the Tier 2 or Tier 5 categories, you should ‘tick’ the box on their CoS. If you do 
not wish to certify maintenance for dependants you must add a ‘Sponsor note’ 
on the CoS, saying this. 
 
If you certify maintenance under the Tier 2 or Tier 5 categories you confirm 
that you will, if needed, maintain and accommodate the migrant up to the end 
of their first month of employment in the UK. You may limit the amount of the 
undertaking, but any limit must be at least £945. If you certify maintenance for 
a Tier 2 or Tier 5 migrant’s dependants, you confirm that you will maintain and 
accommodate them for the first month of any leave that is granted to them. 
You may limit this, but it must be at least £630 per dependant. 
 
40.13  If you certify maintenance, you must make sure the migrants are aware that 
they must not claim state benefits. If they do claim state benefits with your 
knowledge, we will take action against you. 
 
40.14  If you do not wish to certify maintenance at all, the migrant and their 
dependants must all meet the maintenance requirements as set out in the 
relevant guidance and the Immigration Rules and give us the required 
evidence with their application for leave. 
 
"
223,Switching while in the UK,"40.15  Switching is the term we use when a migrant who is already legally in the UK 
moves from one immigration status to another. We only approve an 
application for a migrant to switch immigration category while in the UK if they: 
 
Page 175 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules to be allowed to stay in 
the UK within the category that are applying to switch into 
•  are already in the UK within one category that allows them to switch into 
the category they are applying to switch into 
40.16  If you want to sponsor a migrant under the Tier 2 or Tier 5 categories who is 
already in the UK under another immigration category, you should check that 
their current immigration status allows them to switch into the Tier 2 or Tier 5 
category. This is important if the migrant is in the UK as the dependant of 
another migrant. This is because any dependant switching into Tier 2 
(General) counts towards the annual limit under Tier 2 (General) which means 
they will need a restricted CoS. The Tier 2 (General) annual limit section has 
more information on this. 
 
40.17  Further guidance on switching rules is available in the work visa guidance and 
Part 6A of the Immigration Rules on GOV.UK. 
 
"
224,Extension of permission to stay,"40.18  A migrant with leave under the Tier 2 or Tier 5 categories can apply for an 
extension of their permission to stay, which is known as further leave to 
remain. 
 
40.19  Where the migrant is already working for you and wishes to extend their period 
of leave, for example, if their contract is extended, you must assign a new CoS 
for the extended period. Under the Tier 2 and Tier 5 categories, the 
requirements for extension applications are that: 
 
•  the migrant has been assigned a CoS for their continued employment in 
the same role before making an application for an extension of stay 
•  if the migrant’s original CoS was assigned before 6 April 2013, and the job 
they have been doing is not contained in one of the SOC 2010 codes 
listed in Table 7 of Appendix J to the Immigration Rules, you can assign a 
CoS under the most appropriate SOC 2010 code but only if it is clear that 
the job the migrant is doing did fit in the SOC stated on their original CoS 
and does not fit in one of the transition SOCs or 
•  the migrant has been assigned a CoS for their continued employment in 
another role within the same SOC code that was on their original CoS 
before making an application for an extension of stay and 
•  the job is still at the appropriate skill level (see transitional arrangements 
for SOC codes – skill level for transitional arrangements in respect of 
changes to the SOC codes from 6 April 2013 that may have led to the skill 
level of a particular job being assessed as lower than before) 
•  the migrant will continue to be paid at or above the appropriate rate, the 
‘Rates of pay’ section has more information on when the ‘experienced’ 
rate must be paid to a Tier 2 migrant 
•  in the case of a private servant sponsored under Tier 5 (Temporary 
Worker) International Agreement, that they will continue to work for the 
employer named on their original CoS 
 
Page 176 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
40.20  If you originally carried out a resident labour market test before you started 
sponsoring the migrant, you do not have to do another one. 
 
40.21  We only extend a migrant’s permission to stay up to the maximum time 
allowed under the relevant tier and/or subcategory. 
 
40.22  When you assign a CoS to extend a migrant’s leave in the same tier and 
category, the start date on the CoS should be the day after their current leave 
expires but the migrant cannot apply for leave more than 3 months before that 
date. 
"
225,Change of employment,"40.23  If a migrant sponsored under the Tier 2 or Tier 5 categories changes 
employer, where the conditions (rules) of leave allow this, they must make a 
new application supported by a CoS from their new sponsor. The exception is 
if they are moving to a new sponsor with the Transfer of Undertakings 
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) arrangements or similar 
protection to continue in the same job, due to a takeover, merger or de-merger 
or other circumstance in which TUPE is triggered. 
 
40.24  Where either: 
 
•  you are already sponsoring a migrant who wants to continue working for 
you in a new job within the same SOC code quoted on their CoS or 
•  a migrant is transferring to you with TUPE or similar protection and as part 
of the transfer they move into a new job within the same SOC code that 
was on the CoS assigned to them by their last sponsor 
 
they do not have to make a new application unless they are changing from a 
job which is in a short occupation listed in Appendix K to the Immigration 
Rules, to one that is not. In all cases, the rate of pay for their new job must 
meet the appropriate rate requirements set out in this guidance. 
 
40.25  If a sponsored migrant is changing occupations and will still be employed by 
you but their new job is in a different SOC code, they must make a new 
application. The same applies where a migrant is affected by TUPE or similar 
protection and, as part of their transfer, they change occupation and the new 
job is in a different SOC code. 
 
40.26  The exception is where the migrant is sponsored in a graduate training 
programme. They may change occupation within the programme or at the end 
of the programme without you needing to carry out a further resident labour 
market test or for them to make a new application. You must tell us of the 
change of occupation via the SMS. 
 
40.27  Where a sponsored migrant must make a ‘Change of employment’ application, 
you must first carry out a resident labour market test, if this guidance requires 
it, before you assign a new CoS to them. This could be if a migrant you are 
already sponsoring under Tier 2 (General) wants to continue working for you 
but in a different occupation which is in a different SOC code to the one you 
Page 177 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
quoted on their original CoS. You cannot simply give them the job and assign 
a new CoS to them straight away unless there is an exemption from the 
resident labour market test. 
 
40.28  If the new job is not exempt from the resident labour market test, you must 
carry one out and must only appoint that same migrant if no suitable settled 
workers are available to fill the post. If you fail to carry out a resident labour 
market test in accordance with this guidance, we will take action against you. 
 
40.29  If you assign a CoS to a migrant to change employment, they must then make 
a new application. Their application must be approved before they can start 
work in their new job. 
 
This applies in all cases whether the new job is with the same sponsor or a 
new sponsor. The migrant can continue working in their original job, for their 
original sponsor, provided their last grant of leave has not expired, until the 
start date of the new job, as stated on their new CoS. 
 
40.30  If you sponsor a migrant under Tier 2 who is already in the UK under Tier 2 
having been sponsored by someone else, you need to know about the rules 
that limit a migrant to a maximum of 6 continuous years’ leave in the UK under 
Tier 2. These rules are explained in the guidance for Tier 2 migrants and in 
Part 6A of the Immigration Rules. 
 
Transitional arrangements for changes of job within the 
same standard occupation classification code 
40.31  If you sponsor a migrant whose original certificate of sponsorship (CoS) was 
assigned before 6 April 2013 using a SOC 2000 code and you want to move 
them to a new job that used to be in the same SOC code as the one on their 
CoS, they will not have to make a change of employment application if the 
new job falls within one of the equivalent SOC 2010 codes. You can check this 
by looking at Table 7 in Appendix J to the Immigration Rules, which lists the 
transition from SOC 2000 to SOC 2010 codes. For example, if the migrant’s 
original job fell within SOC 1123 – Managers in Mining and Energy, and their 
new job falls within either: 
•  SOC 1123 – Production managers and directors in mining and energy  
•  SOC 2424 – Business and financial project management professionals  
 
they will not have to make a change of employment application. 
 
Leaving and returning to the UK 
40.32  If a Tier 2 or Tier 5 migrant needs to travel in and out of the UK on a regular 
basis in connection with their job, you can choose to tick the ‘Multiple entry’ 
box when assigning their CoS. If you do this, it does not involve any extra 
benefits or restrictions on the migrant’s ability to travel but does help to show 
their intentions and likely travel plans to us. ‘Multiple entry CoS’ holders must, 
like other applicants, obtain prior entry clearance unless seeking entry for no 
more than 3 months as a non-visa national under the Tier 5 Creative and 
Page 178 of 209

"
226,Transitional arrangements for changes of job within the same standard occupation,
227,Leaving and returning to the UK,"40.32  If a Tier 2 or Tier 5 migrant needs to travel in and out of the UK on a regular 
basis in connection with their job, you can choose to tick the ‘Multiple entry’ 
box when assigning their CoS. If you do this, it does not involve any extra 
benefits or restrictions on the migrant’s ability to travel but does help to show 
their intentions and likely travel plans to us. ‘Multiple entry CoS’ holders must, 
like other applicants, obtain prior entry clearance unless seeking entry for no 
more than 3 months as a non-visa national under the Tier 5 Creative and 
Page 178 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
Sporting visa concession. 
 
40.33  A multiple-entry CoS is not needed by a migrant wanting to travel overseas for 
leisure or domestic purposes during the period you sponsor them. If they take 
annual leave and return home during that period, they can still return to the UK 
to resume work if their leave is still valid.  
 
40.34  If a migrant has been assigned a multiple entry CoS, this does not override the 
rules on periods of unpaid leave. See the ‘Unpaid leave and reductions in 
salary’ section for more information on this. 
 
40.35  If a Tier 2 or Tier 5 migrant has been granted leave to remain in the UK for 6 
months or less, or they are a Tier 5 migrant who was granted leave to enter 
under the Tier 5 Creative and Sporting visa concession, their leave will end 
(lapse) if they leave the Common Travel Area (CTA). The CTA is the UK, 
Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands (Bailiwick of Guernsey and 
Bailiwick of Jersey).  
 
40.36  If a Tier 2 or Tier 5 migrant’s leave lapses as a result of leaving the CTA, or 
otherwise expires while they are outside the UK, they will not be able to re-
enter the UK unless they make a further successful application for entry 
clearance, which must be supported by a new CoS. The migrant may also be 
affected by the cooling-off period. The exception to this is where they are a 
non-visa national who entered the UK under the Tier 5 Creative and Sporting 
visa concession and they are returning under that concession to complete the 
engagements stated on their original CoS. 
 
"
228,The biometric residence permit,"40.37  Migrants applying for entry clearance to the UK for more than 6 months must 
apply for a biometric residence permit (BRP) as part of the application 
process. This involves enrolling their fingerprints and facial image to have their 
identity confirmed. If a successful decision is made on their application for 
entry clearance, a decision letter will tell the migrant from which nominated 
Post Office in the UK they must collect their BRP. They will be provided with a 
short-term biometric entry clearance (a vignette in their passport), valid for 30 
days, in order to travel to the UK to collect their BRP. The migrant then has 10 
days from their arrival in the UK to collect their BRP from that nominated Post 
Office. The BRP will be the sole way of evidencing that the migrant is here 
lawfully and any conditions (rules) of their leave. The ‘Biometric residence 
permits’ page on GOV.UK has more information. 
 
40.38  Tier 2 and Tier 5 migrants applying for leave to remain in the UK have to apply 
for a BRP. Before receiving the BRP, the migrant must give their fingerprints 
and facial image, have their identity confirmed and a successful decision made 
on their application for leave.  
 
40.39  The vast majority of Tier 2 or Tier 5 migrants will use their BRP to evidence 
their right to work in the UK. If they need to start work before collecting their 
BRP, however, they will be able to evidence their right to work by producing 
the short-term biometric entry clearance in their passport which they used to 
Page 179 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
travel to the UK, as long as it is still current. In these circumstances, you will 
need to ask to see their BRP when this vignette expires (30 days after issue). 
The ‘Right to work checks: an employer’s guide’ page on GOV.UK has 
information on how to establish an excuse against a civil penalty liability for 
employing an illegal worker. 
 
40.40  Those coming to live in the UK for more than 6 months will be required under

229,Migrants working on a contract basis,"40.41  Where a migrant is working on a contract basis and is being supplied to one 
organisation by another organisation, their sponsor must be whoever has full 
responsibility for all the duties, functions and outcomes or outputs of the job 
the migrant is doing. Below is an example of this. 
 
Example 
Company A has a contractual obligation with a client ‘Company Z’ to deliver an 
IT solution within an agreed period of time.  
 
A migrant who is sponsored by Company A to do a job on the IT project may 
be sent to work for the length of the contract at Company Z’s premises, but 
they remain employed by Company A throughout the whole period of the 
contract. 
 
As Company A is fully responsible for all the migrant’s duties, functions, 
outputs or outcomes, Company A must be the migrant’s sponsor. 
 
40.42  You can only assign a CoS if you have genuine responsibility for deciding all 
the duties, functions and outcomes or outputs of the job the migrant will be 
doing. Where the migrant is employed by you to do work for another 
organisation to fulfil a contractual obligation on your behalf, they must be 
contracted by you to provide a service or project within a certain period of 
time. This means a service or project which has a specific end date, after 
which it will have ended or the service provided will no longer be operated by 
you or anyone else. They must not be: 
 
•  agency workers, hired to another organisation to fill a position with them, 
whether temporary or permanent, regardless of any genuine contract 
between you and any employment agency or third party (intermediary) 
who supplies workers to an organisation – the ‘Employment agencies and 
employment businesses’ section has more information  
•  contracted to undertake an ongoing routine role or to provide an ongoing 
routine service for the third party (intermediary), regardless of the length of 
any genuine contract between you and another organisation 
 
40.43  If the migrant is self-employed, there must be a genuine contract for 
employment/services between you and the migrant. This contract must show: 
 
•  the names and signatures of all involved (normally, you and the migrant) 
•  the start and end dates of the contract 
Page 180 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
 
•  details of the job, or piece of work the migrant has been contracted to do 
•  an indication of how much the migrant will be paid 
 
40.44  Where we think that you are supplying a migrant to another organisation as 
labour, we may ask for confirmation from the other organisation, that: 
 
•  the migrant works independently from them, and you, as the sponsor, 
have full control over all their duties, functions, outputs or outcomes 
•  the migrant is not being supplied to them to undertake a routine role 
If we find this has happened, we will take action against you. 
 
"
230,Supplementary employment,"40.45  Migrants sponsored under the Tier 2 and Tier 5 categories are allowed, in 
limited circumstances, to undertake other work as well as that which their CoS 
was assigned for. We call this supplementary employment. The exception is 
for private servants sponsored under the Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) 
International Agreement subcategory who are not allowed to take 
supplementary employment. 
 
40.46  Supplementary employment does not have to meet the resident labour market 
test requirements and the employer does not have to be a licensed sponsor.  
 
 
•  be in the same profession and at the same professional level as the work 
for which the migrant’s CoS was assigned or be a job which is in a 
shortage occupation listed in Appendix K to the Immigration Rules - if the 
occupation is later removed from the list of shortage occupations, the 
migrant must finish that employment 
•  be for no more than 20 hours a week 
•  be outside of the normal working hours for which the migrant’s CoS was 
assigned 
 
Migrants do not need to advise us of any supplementary employment they 
undertake as long as it meets these criteria. 
 
40.47  A migrant should advise their new employer that the employment is 
supplementary to the work they are being sponsored to do, so that their 
supplementary employer can make the necessary checks described in our 
guidance for employers on illegal working. The ‘Right to work checks: an 
employer's guide’ page on GOV.UK has more information. 
 
"
231,Secondary employment,"40.48  Once a migrant sponsored under Tier 2 has used their CoS to gain leave to 
enter or remain in the UK and has started work, they are allowed to apply to 
take other employment which does not meet the supplementary employment 
criteria. We call this secondary employment. 
 
Page 181 of 209  
 
Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
40.49  Any secondary employment must be with a licensed sponsor and the migrant 
must be able to meet the criteria relevant to the category in which their 
secondary employment falls. The secondary employer must have recruited 
them in line with the rules set out in this guidance. The secondary employer 
must assign a new CoS to the migrant so that they can make an application to 
vary their existing leave or worker authorisation.  
 
Note: a second CoS cannot be assigned to a migrant until the migrant has 
used their first one. 
 
"
232,Educational courses,"40.50  Migrants sponsored under Tier 2 and Tier 5 may do courses of study. There is 
no limit on the number of hours they can study or level of course they 
undertake. However, we would expect that any study done does not affect 
their ability to carry out the job they have been employed to do. If they intend 
to study a discipline listed in Appendix 6 to the Immigration Rules and are 18 
years of age or over, they must obtain an Academic Technology Approval 
Scheme (ATAS) clearance certificate in respect of this course from the 
Counter-Proliferation Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
prior to commencing their study. Study may be undertaken anywhere the 
migrant chooses and does not have to be with a licensed Tier 4 sponsor. 
 
What happens if a migrant applies for settlement (also 
called indefinite leave to remain)? 
40.51  The maximum time that a Tier 2 migrant may be in the UK under the Tier 2 
(General), Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) or Tier 2 (Sportsperson) categories is 6 
years. After 5 years, the migrant may apply for settlement (also called 
‘indefinite leave to remain’ (ILR)) in the UK.  
 
40.52  If a Tier 2 migrant applies for ILR as a Tier 2 migrant, you will need to support 
this application with evidence. This is currently a letter confirming the: 
 
•  migrant is still wanted for the same job, and will be needed for the 
foreseeable future 
•  absences of the person from the UK, the periods and purposes of work-
related absences and their periods of annual leave 
•  amount of the migrant’s salary and that this is their regular salary – you 
will also need to confirm that the salary is not expected to reduce once 
they have been granted ILR, and that the salary is at or above the 
appropriate rate 
 
We may check this during a compliance visit.

242,Annex 9: new points-based immigration system from January 2021,
243,Background,"On 19 February 2020, the Government published a policy statement setting out the 
high-level details of the UK’s points-based immigration system. These new 
arrangements will start operating from 1 January 2021, once freedom of movement 
with the European Union (EU) has ended. It will provide for a single system for EU 
and non-EU citizens alike and aims to attract people who can contribute to the UK’s 
economy. Irish citizens will continue to be able to enter and live in the UK as they do 
now. 
 
The new points-based system will include a route for skilled workers who have a job 
offer from an approved employer (‘sponsor’). This will replace the existing Tier 2 
(General) route. From 1 January 2021, the job will need to be at a required skill level 
of level 3 or above on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF), or the 
equivalent level in Wales or Scotland. This is approximately equivalent to A-level 
standard. The migrant will need to be able to speak English. The minimum general 
salary threshold will be reduced from £30,000 to £25,600 (with lower salaries in 
certain circumstances, such as new entrants to the labour market). An individual 
migrant may be able to ‘trade’ certain characteristics against the salary that they 
would otherwise be required to earn for the occupation in question. Further 
information on how the new points-based system will work are in the policy 
statement. 
 
"
244,If you are not currently a licensed sponsor,"If you are not currently approved to be a sponsor but think that you are likely to need 
to sponsor skilled migrant workers from 1 January 2021, you can apply for approval 
(a ‘sponsor licence’) now. You will need to show that you will be able to offer genuine 
employment skilled to level RQF3 or above. Details of which jobs are currently 
considered to be RQF3 or above are contained in Appendix J to the Immigration 
Rules. You should note that this list is subject to change and jobs that are currently 
considered to be RQF3 may not be when the new system goes live. Further 
information on this will be provided later in the year.  
 
You must meet all of the requirements set out in this guidance, except the current 
requirement to offer employment at RQF6 or above. You are strongly advised to read 
all parts of the sponsor guidance for employers, including relevant appendices, 
before you apply. These are available on the ‘Sponsorship policy guidance’ page on 
GOV.UK.

Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
"
245,How to apply for a licence,"To apply, you must complete the online application form on GOV.UK and provide the 
mandatory documents specified in Appendix A to the sponsor guidance.  
 
On your application form, you should provide as much information as you can on 
how many migrant workers you are likely to employ during the first year of your 
licence, including any you wish to sponsor at RQF level 3 and above from 1 January 
2021. This will determine your allocation of certificates of sponsorship (CoS) if your 
application is approved. A CoS is an electronic record that you will need to ‘assign’ to 
a migrant before they can apply for entry clearance (a visa) to, or leave to remain in, 
the UK.  
 
You are encouraged to apply early, even if you are not currently in a position to 
sponsor migrants under the existing system, or are not sure if or when you will need 
sponsor migrants under the new system from January 2021. In such cases, provided 
you meet all of the other requirements set out in this guidance, we can grant you a 
licence but will not allocate any CoS to you at this stage. Once you know that you will 
need to appoint migrant workers, you can request the number of CoS you need. 
Guidance on how to do this is contained in Sponsorship Management System (SMS) 
Manual 2 in the section entitled ‘How to request and withdraw a request for a 
CoS/CAS allocation increase’. 
 
"
246,If your application is approved,"If your application for a sponsor licence is approved, you should note that: 
 
•  you will not at the current time be able to assign any CoS to sponsor migrants 
for jobs at RQF levels 3 to 5, unless an exception to the current skill level 
requirement set out in this guidance applies – see ‘Assigning a CoS for RQF 
level 3 to 5 jobs’ below for further information 
•  any migrant sponsored to undertake a job at RQF levels 3 to 5 must not apply 
for entry clearance or leave to remain until the new points-based system comes 
into effect, unless an exception to the current skill level requirment set out in 
this guidance applies – if they do, their application will be refused and we may 
take compliance action against you 
•  the list of jobs currently considered to be RQF3 or above may change before 
the new system comes into effect 
•  a CoS for jobs for EU, EEA or Swiss migrants at RQF level 6 or above is only 
required where those migrants are applying to come to the UK on or after 1 
January 2021 
•  if you are not allocated any CoS, you can apply for an increase to your CoS 
allocation when you know that you will need to appoint a migrant worker 
 
"
247,Assigning a CoS for RQF level 3 to 5 jobs,"If your application is approved, you will not be able to assign any CoS to sponsor 
migrants at RQF levels 3 to 5 yet, unless the job is covered by one of the current 
skill-level exceptions.

Tiers 2 and 5: guidance for sponsors - version 07/20 
 
 
We intend to start accepting applications under the new points-based system from 
Autumn 2020. We will provide further detail on GOV.UK over the coming months and 
will update this guidance as soon as possible to confirm the earliest date: 
 
•  you can assign CoS for use under the new system 
•  migrants can apply for entry clearance or leave to remain under the new 
system 
 
You can assign any CoS you have been allocated under the current Tier 2 (General) 
arrangements as soon as you need to, provided the job meets the current skill-level 
and all other relevant requirements.  
 
"
248,If your application for a licence is refused,"If we are not satisfied that you can offer genuine employment at RQF level 3 or 
above, or you do not otherwise meet the requirements set out in this guidance, we 
will refuse your application. If your application is refused, we will not refund your 
application fee and you will not be eligible to apply again for at least 6 months (longer 
in some cases). See sections 7, 8 and 9 of this guidance for information on how we 
consider applications, and section 10 for information on ‘cooling-off’ periods if we 
refuse your application.

249,Further information,"GOV.UK website as it becomes available. We will also update this guidance as the 
new system develops.
