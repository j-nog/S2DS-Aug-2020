The Home Office will be responsible for transferring my application and \\nsupporting documents safely. In these circumstances my application will still be handled in line with Home Office published customer service standards.\\n• The fee payable is for an application processing and entry clearance decision-making service, not the guaranteed delivery of a visa, therefore I will not be entitled to \\na refund should my application for entry to the UK or Commonwealth and Overseas Territories be refused or granted for a shorter period than I applied for.\\n• My visa application fee will be refunded only if the application is withdrawn in writing within 3 months and 7 days of the original date of application and prior to the \\nsubmission of biometric data or any processing taking place\\n• The information provided by me, or information made available to the Home Office during the processing of my application, may be shared with my sponsor(s) or \\nany person(s) acting on their behalf or any applicant linked to my application (for example to my spouse/partner if we apply for visas for a trip together) for the sole \\npurpose of considering my application. I am aware that if there is any information I do not want the Home Office to disclose I will tell you by enclosing a letter with my \\nsupporting documentation. If such requests prevent you from making legitimate inquires, my application may be refused.\\n• My application will be automatically refused and I may be banned from going to the UK for 10 years if I use a false document, lie or withhold relevant information. \\nI may also be banned if I have breached immigration laws in the UK. Should I use a false document, lie or withhold relevant information my details may be passed to \\nlaw enforcement agencies.\\n• I may be required to provide a record of my fingerprints and a photograph of my face (“biometric data”) as part of my application. If I refuse to do so, my \\napplication may be treated as invalid and, if so will not be considered further. (see Statutory Instrument 2006 No 1743 – The immigration (Provision of Physical Data) \\nregulations 2006, Regulation 7(1)).\\n•  I understand that providing biometric information as part of an application is confirmation of consent to having biometric information checked at the UK border to \\nverify identity.\\n• I do not have recourse to public funds during my stay in the UK.\\n•  I am not entitled to receive treatment free of charge on the National Health Service (NHS), unless an exemption from charge applies in law, and therefore may be \\nbilled for any NHS treatment undertaken in the UK.\\n• If I fail to pay NHS debts incurred by me this could adversely affect future entry clearance or leave to remain applications I make.\\n• I am not entitled to receive state-funded education whilst in the UK.\\n• My details may, in certain circumstances, be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent and detect fraud and money laundering. I also understand that such \\nagencies may provide the Home Office with information about me. Further details explaining when information may be passed to or from fraud prevention agencies \\nand how that information may be used can be obtained via the visas and immigration pages on the gov.uk website.\\n• It is an offence under the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended) to make a statement which I know to be false, or not believe to be true, in order to obtain a visa/\\nentry clearance to the UK  \\n\\nI confirm:\\n• that, where I have a sponsor, I have informed my sponsor of the information set out below and my sponsor has confirmed that they consent to me providing the\\n\\ninformation about them which is set out in this application.\\n\\n• That, I understand and agree with the above declarations and hereby apply for a visa/entry clearance to the United Kingdom.\\n\\nInformation for sponsors \\n\\nPersonal information which is provided about a person acting in support of an application, including any documentary evidence provided by or about them, will \\nbe processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 by the Home Office, which is the data controller in relation to the information provided. \\nThe Home Office will use this information to make decisions about the application and to prevent and detect fraud. We may share this information with other government \\ndepartments or agencies, local and public authorities, foreign governments, companies (including financial and utility companies), employers or other bodies in order to \\nmake reasonable checks to verify the information provided in the application and confirm that sponsors have or will comply with the terms of any visa which may be or \\nhave been granted.
